# Reduced Food Waste

Reducing food waste is the NUMBER ONE recommended climate solution from Project Drawdown.

The total [emissions from the food system rise to ~34%](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-021-00225-9) when considering emissions associated with food waste rotting in landfills plus cooking, refrigerating, processing, transporting, and packaging food. That makes food the single largest emitting economic sector – larger than power generation, industry, transportation, or buildings.

## Overview

- Globally, about one-third of all food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted, amounting to approximately 1.3 billion tonnes per year ([FAO](http://www.fao.org/food-loss-and-food-waste/en/)).
- Food waste contributes to roughly 8-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions ([UNEP Food Waste Index Report 2021](https://www.unep.org/resources/report/unep-food-waste-index-report-2021)).
- In the United States alone, families discard food worth about $1,500 annually ([Natural Resources Defense Council](https://www.nrdc.org/resources/wasted-how-america-losing-40-percent-its-food-farm-fork-landfill)).

## Environmental Impact

- If food waste were a country, it would be the third-largest greenhouse gas emitter after China and the United States ([FAO](http://www.fao.org/food-loss-and-food-waste/en/)).
- Food waste in landfills produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas with 25 times the global warming potential of CO2 ([EPA](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases)).
- Wasted food also represents a significant loss of water, land, and energy resources used in production.

4. **Home Composting Solutions**: [Mill](https://mill.com) offers a special household compost bin that turns food waste into livestock feed.

5. **Waste-to-Energy**: [Generate Upcycle](https://generateupcycle.com/) uses anaerobic digestion to convert food waste into renewable energy and organic fertilizers.

## Case Studies

1. **South Korea's Food Waste Reduction**: Implemented a pay-as-you-throw system, reducing food waste by 10% in its first year ([World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/01/south-korea-recycling-food-waste/)).

2. **IKEA's Food Waste Initiative**: Reduced food waste in its restaurants by 54% in one year through staff training and customer engagement ([IKEA Sustainability Report FY18](https://www.ikea.com/ms/en_JP/pdf/sustainability_report/IKEA_Sustainability_Report_FY18.pdf)).

## Policy Measures and Regulations

1. France's law prohibiting supermarkets from throwing away unsold food
2. EU's Farm to Fork Strategy targeting food waste reduction
3. US Food Date Labeling Act to standardize expiration dates

## Economic Benefits

- Potential global savings of $700 billion per year by reducing food waste ([BCG](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2018/tackling-1.6-billion-ton-food-loss-and-waste-crisis)).
- Job creation in food recovery, recycling, and upcycling sectors.
- Reduced costs for businesses in the food industry.

## Challenges and Best Path Forward

### Challenges
- Lack of awareness and education
- Inadequate infrastructure for food recovery and recycling
- Complex supply chains and logistical challenges

### Best Path Forward
1. Increase public awareness through education campaigns.
2. Implement supportive policies and financial incentives.
3. Invest in research and development of waste-reduction technologies.
4. Improve infrastructure for food recovery, recycling, and composting.
5. Foster collaboration between government, businesses, and consumers.
