# Hard Questions

## What is the role of [nature based solutions](../nature-based-solutions)?

## Should we tax carbon instead of using carbon markets?

*\--?*

## Notes

*Regarding LCOE, the critical thing to note is that drivers of reduction of LCOE often come from the hard tech/deep tech side, and many bets need to be placed on this hard tech before we can commercialize this.*
