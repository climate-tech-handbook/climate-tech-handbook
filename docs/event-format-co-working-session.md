## Primary goal - demonstrate community

When people see a group photo with friendly faces, they feel welcome.

By hosting a Co-Working Session, you are proving that a community exists and there are others like you who want to solve the climate crisis.


## There are 5 steps

:::note The 5 Steps
1. Pick a Venue

2. Create a Sharable Event

3. Share the Event

4. Show Up

5. Share the Results
:::

## 1. Pick a Venue

Make a list of potential venues.

Consider
- **Size** (not to small)

- **Location** (easy to get to)

- **Amenities** (food on site, electricity outlets, not too noisy)

:::tip
As your list of venues grow, **Share It** for future reference with other organizers.
:::

Should you call the venue?

If your not expecting a large turnout and don't need a special area for your group, this may not be necessary.

That said, it never hurts to inquire about making a reservation for your desired event date(s). 

If a venue requires a reservation fee, you may have luck requesting a waiver in support of the climate change community.

It's good to build a relationship with venues for future events.

## 2. Create a Sharable Event
Use a tool such as [Luma](https://lu.ma) to craft a sharable event. Ensure the climate theme and any other goals or activities are clear.

## 3. Share the Event!
Utilize various marketing channels such as social media platforms, email newsletters, and your personal network to spread the word. Encourage others to share the event.

:::tip
In Seattle - we use the [Work on Climate Slack](workonclimate.org) and post in the #meet-seattle channel  
:::

## 4. Show Up
1. Beforehand, gather any required materials. Common materials are markers and name tags.

2. Arrive early on the event day to ensure space, address any last-minute concerns, and be ready to welcome attendees with organization and enthusiasm.

3. Consider having project leaders share what they're working on to break the ice. Keep in mind, some people may just want to focus with their laptop and enjoy the ambience.

:::info Remember
Take a big group photo!

## 5. Share the Results!
After the event, utilize social media to share the highlights with those who attended and those who missed out. Sharing the results not only celebrates the success of the event but also encourages future engagement and participation.
