## Overview

- **Biogas**: Produced from the breakdown of organic matter like food waste, manure, and sewage through anaerobic digestion.
- **Application**: Used for cooking, heating, and powering vehicles.
- **Greenhouse Gas Reduction**: Replaces traditional fuels, leading to fewer greenhouse gas emissions.
- **Leaders in Biogas Promotion**: Biogas industry, United Nations, World Bank.

## Progress Made

Significant advancements in biogas technology have led to reduced greenhouse gas emissions and increased adoption of biogas systems:

A new method can convert 95 percent of biogas into [green fuel methanol](https://www.technology.org/2024/05/28/gas-strategy-fuels-concerns-about-the-cost-of-energy/) without adding hydrogen, making green methanol much cheaper to produce than before.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Effective GHG Reduction**: Biogas can play a pivotal role in climate change mitigation.
2. **Early-stage Technology**: While promising, the technology is still evolving with both successes and failures.
3. **Local Community Engagement**: Vital for the success of the technology as locals are primary users.
4. **Affordability & Accessibility**: Crucial for the adoption of the technology in communities.
5. **Leading Organizations**: The Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves and the Biogas Consortium are among the entities pushing for increased biogas use.

## Challenges Ahead

1. **Lack of Public Awareness**: Many are unfamiliar with biogas and its benefits.
2. **Need for Infrastructure**: Investment in infrastructure and technology is critical for wider adoption.
3. **Governmental Support**: More support from governments can accelerate the adoption and implementation of biogas solutions.
4. **Economic Barriers**: High initial costs and lack of established markets for biogas products.

## Best Path Forward

1. **Raising Awareness**: Prioritize public education about biogas technology and its environmental benefits.
2. **Research & Development**: Invest in refining and innovating biogas technology.
3. **Governmental Incentives**: Collaborate with policymakers to incentivize biogas adoption.
4. **Private Sector Collaboration**: Form partnerships with businesses to bolster the use of biogas solutions.
5. **Key Players**: The World Bank, UNDP, and the Biogas Partnership Programme are integral in promoting and refining biogas solutions.
