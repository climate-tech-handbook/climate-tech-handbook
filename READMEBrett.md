I  made a build folder and put it on Render.com and it works fine on all browsers.  
We can try it on Netlify now to test ,  Thats about all I can do until we see if it works.
I cant get the old develop  branch to work its from 9 months ago and the update might have messed it up  from 3 months ago.   So that needs work.  
I think it is the way netlify is interpreting something, it probably has the image confused.  Try it now after I moved them around and changed the name by adding a 2 to the end. That little trick by changing the name works often for me on other things. I just moved them because I know that that other path is working fine for the image above them.   Test to see. while we figure out the deploy branch in the near future.
