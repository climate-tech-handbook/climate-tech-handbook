## Primary goal - demonstrate community

When people see a group photo with friendly faces, they feel welcome.

By hosting a Happy Hour, you are proving that a community exists and there are others like you who want to solve the climate crisis.


## There are 5 steps

:::note The 5 Steps
1. Pick a Venue

2. Create a Sharable Event

3. Share the Event

4. Show Up

5. Share the Results
:::

## Pick a Venue

Make a list of potential venues.

Consider:

- **Comfort** (plenty of space, pleasant atmosphere)

- **Location** (easy to get to)

- **Amenities** (tables for food or refreshments, )

As your list of venues grow, **Share It** for future reference with other organizers.


Should you reserve?

If your not expecting a large turnout and don't need a special area for your group, this may not be necessary.

That said, it never hurts to inquire about making a reservation for your desired event date(s). 


## Create a Sharable Event
Use a tool such as [Luma](https://lu.ma) to craft a sharable event. Ensure the climate theme and any other goals or activities are clear.

You may want to advertise any games, icebreakers, or other attractive things to expect.

:::tip Icebreakers
- **Mini Lightning talks** - people come up and talk for a few minutes to talk about something important to them
- **Interactive Q&A** - someone announces a question they have, for example, something about their job search.
<br></br>Everyone who has the same question, moves to form a single "QUESTION LINE". 
<br></br>Everyone who has an answer to share, moves to a second "ANSWER LINE" directly across the QUESTION LINE.
<br></br>People from the ANSWER LINE take turns sharing their insightful answers to the QUESTION LINE
- **The Wind Blows** - this is designed for like-minded people to figure out who they want to connect with.<br></br>People take turns saying "The Wind Blows For _______" (then fill in the blank with something about your identity).
<br></br>For example: "The Wind Blows for the built environment" or "The Wind Blows for alternatives to meat" or "The Wind Blows for forest tech"

## Share the Event!
Utilize various marketing channels such as social media platforms, email newsletters, and your personal network to spread the word. Encourage others to share the event.

## Show Up
1. Beforehand, gather any required materials. Common materials are markers and name tags, and food.

2. Arrive early on the event day to set up, address any last-minute concerns, and be ready to welcome attendees with organization and enthusiasm.

Take a big group photo!

## Share the Results!
After the event, utilize social media to share the highlights with those who attended and those who missed out. Sharing the results not only celebrates the success of the event but also encourages future engagement and participation.
