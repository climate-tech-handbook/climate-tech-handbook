_Climate Action Venn Diagram - by [Ayana Elizabeth Johnson](https://www.ayanaelizabeth.com/climatevenn)_


### Humanity needs you right now.

:::note the hard reality

- **We only have about 5 years** - until we hit 1.5C average warming. <!--make url-->
- **We are way off target** - we need to reduce greenhouse pollution by 50% before 2030, and 100% before 2050.
- **People are suffering** - [5 million deaths per year](https://grist.org/climate/how-many-people-has-climate-change-killed-already/) and [billions of economic damage](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/beyond-data/2021-us-billion-dollar-weather-and-climate-disasters-historical) already.

No wonder you feel **powerless and overwhelmed**.

_but guess what..._

:::tip there is hope
## It's not all bad news!
- **There are over 4,000 companies** - solving the climate crisis
- **Many of these organizations are hiring** - and will continue to hire
- **Hundreds of billions of dollars** - are being poured into this problem, and more money is coming
