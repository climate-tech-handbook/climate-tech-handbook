## Overview

* The **EPA’s Agricultural Waste Management Field Handbook** provides comprehensive guidelines for efficient manure management, emphasizing its benefits, the available management systems, and their design and operation. It also details manure nutrients and their environmental significance.
* Breakthrough technologies to bolster manure management and curtail greenhouse gas emissions include **Anaerobic Digestion**, **Covered Lagoon**, **Nutrient Management Planning**, **Phosphorus Recovery**, **Manure Injection**, and **Manure Separation**.

## Progress Made

* Key innovations in improving manure management entail the anaerobic digestion process, covered lagoons, and advanced manure application. These have directly led to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
* **United States Environmental Protection Agency**, **United States Department of Agriculture**, and **National Renewable Energy Laboratory** have been pioneering these technological advancements.

## Lessons Learned

* Manure management is paramount in slashing greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural activities. This spans manure storage, handling, application, and composting.
* Economic viability is critical to ensure farmers adopt improved manure management practices. They should either save money for farmers or have potential revenue-generation models.
* Social acceptability is another decisive factor. The practices shouldn't create nuisances or health/environmental risks.

## Challenges Ahead

* Enabling the large-scale application of improved manure management practices remains a challenge.
* Overcoming impediments to this technology’s adoption is crucial. This necessitates: a. **Education**: Farmers and stakeholders should be informed of its benefits. b. **Infrastructure & Training**: Investments are needed to support the broad-scale acceptance of this approach.

Front-runners in spearheading solutions in this domain include the **United States Environmental Protection Agency**, **United States Department of Agriculture**, and **Natural Resources Conservation Service**.

## Best Path Forward

For optimal development and execution of Improved Manure Management to combat climate change:

1. **R&D Investment**: Pour resources into research and tech development through diverse funding models.
2. **Large-scale Implementation**: Government-backed incentives, regulations, and awareness initiatives can facilitate wide adoption.

Leaders in this venture comprise the **United States Environmental Protection Agency**, **United States Department of Agriculture**, and the **United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization**. Their efforts have been characterized by tech innovations, implementation of voluntary measures, and legislations.
