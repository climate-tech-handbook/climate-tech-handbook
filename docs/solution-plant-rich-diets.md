## Overview

- By reducing worldwide cattle numbers, we can achieve immediate climate gains due to methane's short half-life. Additionally, industrial livestock reduction prevents destruction of biodiverse habitat that are ideal [land sinks](../sector-land-sinks).
- Beef is more [resource-intensive](https://www.wri.org/insights/6-pressing-questions-about-beef-and-climate-change-answered) than other meats, and animal-based foods require more resources than plant-based foods.
- Shifting towards plant-based diets offers the greatest potential for positive impact, surpassing increased yields, agricultural efficiency, and reduced food waste.

## Progress Made

Food design technologies are revolutionizing plant-based options, enhancing taste and aroma. Advancements like extrudable fat technology, introducing new food resources, and climate-first supply chain technologies are transforming the way we eat. Embracing these innovations allows us to make sustainable choices for a healthier future.

Here are the [latest technology](https://gfi.org/science/the-science-of-plant-based-meat/) developments:

* Lab-grown meat (CBM): Stem cells from animal biopsy are grown in bioreactors to form muscle, fat, and connective tissue for meat production.
* Plant- and fungi-based meat (PBM): Plant ingredients undergo sourcing, processing, and formulation stages to replace functional components in animal products through R&D.
* Recreate products have a low background flavor: The goal is to maintain a low background flavor in products without overpowering the subtler tastes of conventional meat or seafood.

## Key Players

Here is a list of 10 prominent players in the plant-based meat market:

1. Beyond Meat
2. Impossible Foods Inc.
3. Morningstar Farms
4. Quorn Foods
5. Lightlife Foods, Inc.
6. Tofurky
7. Amy's Kitchen, Inc.
8. Dr. Praeger's Sensible Foods
9. Trader Joe's
10. Yves Veggie Cuisine (The Hain-Celestial Canada, ULC)

## Lessons Learned

* Plant-based non-vegetarian alternatives market on the rise due to animal-borne infection risks, health concerns, and demand for good food commodities.
* Growing public understanding and demand for plant-based alternatives driven by health benefits and appeal to flexitarians.
* Increasing awareness of food system's climate impact influencing consumer purchasing decisions.
* [50%](https://www.unilever.com/news/news-search/2023/five-trends-that-will-take-plantbased-eating-mainstream-in-2023/) of flexitarians interested in following food trends.
* [42%](https://www.unilever.com/news/news-search/2023/five-trends-that-will-take-plantbased-eating-mainstream-in-2023/) of consumers worldwide expect plant-based foods to replace meat in the next decade.

## Challenges Ahead

* Plant-based meat industry growth limited by population sensitivity to soy and gluten and high prices.
* Incorrect perception of taste of plant-based beef products can hinder market expansion.
* Plant-based meat is significantly more expensive than conventional meat on a per-pound basis, according to Nielsen data.
* [Analysts](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/15/business/beyond-meat-impossible-emissions.html) find it challenging to assess the sustainability of plant-based foods due to limited transparency regarding emissions.

## Best Path Forward

The future of plant-based foods in the restaurant industry appears promising as the demand for such options grows. 

* Growing adoption of plant-based diets driven by health, environmental, and ethical considerations.
* Restaurants adapting and expanding plant-based options to meet the increasing demand.
* Offering plant-based choices helps attract new customers and appeal to younger demographics.
* Restaurants staying competitive in a crowded market by embracing plant-based trends.
* Initiatives like Veganuary demonstrate popularity, with rapid sign-ups in January.
