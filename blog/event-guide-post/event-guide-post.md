Hey folks ðŸ‘‹ due to all the Climate Event Organizing taking place around the world, I decided it's time to seed "The Ultimate" guide for event organizers.

## [Here is the link to the Climate Event Event Guide](../event-guide)

## I want to show people:

1. Anyone can organize an event

2. They are a highly successful job searching tactic

3. Community organizing is a highly successful climate solution tactic


[I look forward to your feedback](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jacobcaggiano_climate-event-organizers-guide-the-climate-activity-7218707366513451008-hMF6).
