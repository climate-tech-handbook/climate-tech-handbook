## Grammar

- Comma: Use the Oxford comma. That is, when you are listing three things or more, use a comma after each item in the list, and use a comma before "and."
- Percent: Use the percent sign (%) rather than "percent," especially in numerical lists.
- United States: Use "United States" for use as a noun. Use "U.S." for use as an adjective.
