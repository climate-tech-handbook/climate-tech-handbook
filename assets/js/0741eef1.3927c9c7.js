Additionally, it is important to have a robust monitoring and detection system in place to identify and quantify methane leaks. This system should be able to detect leaks at all stages of their development, from small to large. Additionally, the system should be able to rapidly identify and quantify leaks, and it should be able to monitor multiple leaks simultaneously.
