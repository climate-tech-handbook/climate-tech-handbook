## Overview

- **Bioplastics** are made from renewable sources (corn, sugar cane) and replace fossil fuel-based plastics.
- Bioplastics are **recyclable**, **compostable**, and help curb landfill emissions.
- Companies leading bioplastics development: NatureWorks, BASF, Dow Chemical.
- Organizations like **Biodegradable Products Institute** promote bioplastics and certify compostable products.



## Lessons Learned

- **Bioplastics** are promising but require proper **development** and **implementation**.

- Bioplastics' slower degradation requires **proper disposal**.
- Leading entities: **Neste**, **BASF**, **Novamont**.
- More work needed to optimize bioplastics' effectiveness.

## Challenges Ahead


- **Rapid and complete degradation** needed; some bioplastics degrade slowly or incompletely.
- **Cost-competitiveness** with traditional plastics remains a challenge.

## Companies/Organizations Leading:

-  **BASF**: A major chemical company pioneering various bioplastics.
- **Novamont**: An Italian company producing bioplastics from renewable sources, including corn starch.
- **Mango Materials**: A US company creating biodegradable plastics from methane gas.

## Best Path Forward


- **Shift usage** towards less plastic consumption and better recycling practices.
- Change **perception of plastic**: use responsibly, opt for reusable or recyclable options.
- Leading organizations include **Bioplastics International**, **Bioplastic Feedstock Alliance**, **Bioplastic Product Catalog**, and **Bioplasticity Forum**.
