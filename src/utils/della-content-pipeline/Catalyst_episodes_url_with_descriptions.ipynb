In this episode, Shayle talks to Trevor Houser, partner at the Rhodium Group, about the organization’s new Clean Investment Monitor, a database of climatetech investments developed with the MIT Center on Energy and Environmental Policy Research. Trevor highlights three different categories of policy impacts:  Sectors where policy accelerated existing trends, like solar deployment and EV sales.  Sectors where policy catalyzed new growth that probably would not have happened otherwise, like in manufacturing, hydrogen, carbon management, and sustainable aviation fuels.  Sectors that are declining despite policy incentives, like the deployment of wind and heat pumps.   They discuss the drivers behind these trends and cover topics like:  The regional clustering of manufacturing investment and new geographic hubs, like the Southwest.  The surprising growth in hydrogen made from steam methane reforming, also known as blue hydrogen.

This episode we’re diving into food. The connections are myriad. Food itself is just a means of energy storage, and a particularly good one at that. While photosynthesis is remarkably inefficient—averaging only 0.3% globally, compared to 90% or more in an electric motor—it stores energy for weeks to years. In the U.S. we use around 12% of our energy to produce food, in the form of inputs like diesel, fertilizer, and electricity. Meanwhile, the food system itself provides fuel to the rest of the energy system, through ethanol and other forms of bioenergy. So how do all these things fit together?\\xa0 In this episode, Shayle talks to Dr. Webber, professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Texas–Austin, and chief technology officer at Energy Impact Partners, where Shayle is a partner. They cover topics like:  The Green revolution, which added more energy to food production, improving yields while reducing the amount of people required  The categories of energy consumption, such as fertilizers, on-site fuel, transportation, the cold chain and cooking  Food waste, which in the U.S. reaches about 30 - 50% of edible food  Why buying local is not necessarily good for the environment  Why we should not use food for fuel, unless it’s waste by-products from food production  How climate change affects the food system, for example by reducing the efficiency of photosynthesis and requiring more refrigeration to reduce spoilage  The viability of indoor agriculture   Recommended Resources:   Climavores: Bursting the ‘eat local’ bubble   Catalyst: The 3 pathways to alternative proteins   Catalyst: From biowaste to \\u200b‘biogold’   Catalyst: How well does soil actually store carbon?

They reduce charging load or even inject energy back onto the grid. They back up renewables when the wind doesn’t blow or the sun doesn’t shine.\\xa0 That’s the vision for managed charging, or V1G, and vehicle-to-grid, or V2G. There’s also a third technology called vehicle-to-home that allows an EV battery to power a building, just like a home battery. Collectively these technologies are called V2X. There’s reason to think this V2X dream could become a reality. They’re already happening at small scales. And when they reach larger scales, the cumulative impact could be big. A recent Nature study found that by 2030 the total battery capacity across the world’s mobile batteries could be more than two terawatt hours, climbing to more than 30 terawatt hours by 2050. But first, these technologies need to overcome some big barriers—costly grid upgrades, degrading batteries, drivers worried about being left without a charge—just to name a few.\\xa0 So what will V2X actually look like? In this episode, Shayle talks to Ty Jagerson, leader of V2X at GM. They cover topics like:  The contracts GM is signing with customers to manage their charging  Reassuring EV owners that managed charging is not going to leave them without a charge  What kind of compensation EV owners could get for V2G and whether the value to companies will be worth the costs  The carrots and sticks of V2G: compensation and time-of-use charges  Whether V2G will be more valuable for capacity or energy markets  Whether V2G will degrade batteries and violate manufacturer warranties   Recommended Resources:   Canary Media: Is \\u200b‘vehicle-to-everything’ charging ready for prime time?

It’s a show about one of the most complex machines ever built – the power grid. It’s a machine that’s changing faster than ever. With Great Power is about the people driving that change: A third of the world's largest companies now have net-zero targets in place for carbon emissions. Google was ahead of the curve. Back in 2007, it had already achieved its goal of going carbon neutral across all of its offices and data centers around the globe. But as demand for Google's services expanded, it knew that it had to overhaul its energy goals. At the time, Raiford Smith served as Google's global head of energy and location strategy. And part of his job was jump-starting this massive effort. In 2021, Google launched one of the most ambitious corporate energy strategies ever. And Raiford and his team made it possible. After a career spanning more than 30 years at utilities like Duke Energy, CPS, Entergy, and Southern company, and two years at Google, Raiford knows firsthand that change is possible at power companies. This week, Brad talked with Raiford, now the chief innovation officer at AES, about what's needed to spur tech innovation at utilities, and the technologies that will be integral to the energy transition.  This podcast is produced by GridX. GridX is the Enterprise Rate Platform that modern utilities rely on to usher in our clean energy future.

It’s a show about one of the most complex machines ever built – the power grid. It’s a machine that’s changing faster than ever. With Great Power is about the people driving that change:</p><p>A third of the world&#39;s largest companies now have net-zero targets in place for carbon emissions. Google was ahead of the curve. Back in 2007, it had already achieved its goal of going carbon neutral across all of its offices and data centers around the globe.</p><p>But as demand for Google&#39;s services expanded, it knew that it had to overhaul its energy goals. At the time, Raiford Smith served as Google&#39;s global head of energy and location strategy. And part of his job was jump-starting this massive effort.</p><p>In 2021, Google launched one of the most ambitious corporate energy strategies ever. And Raiford and his team made it possible.</p><p>After a career spanning more than 30 years at utilities like Duke Energy, CPS, Entergy, and Southern company, and two years at Google, Raiford knows firsthand that change is possible at power companies.</p><p>This week, Brad talked with Raiford, now the chief innovation officer at AES, about what&#39;s needed to spur tech innovation at utilities, and the technologies that will be integral to the energy transition.</p><p><br /></p><p>This podcast is produced by GridX. GridX is the Enterprise Rate Platform that modern utilities rely on to usher in our clean energy future.</p><p>Catalyst is a co-production of<a href=\"https://postscriptmedia.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Post Script Media</a> and<a href=\"https://www.canarymedia.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Canary Media</a>.</p><p>Catalyst is supported by Antenna Group.

The bank catered to entrepreneurs in tech, especially climate. So when news of SVB’s troubled assets hit social media, startups scrambled to withdraw millions of dollars and draft emergency plans to make payroll. But after the Federal Insurance Deposit Corporation (FDIC) took over SVB and another troubled regional institution, Signature Bank, the dust started to settle. The FDIC announced that it would insure the full deposits at SVB, above the $250,000 guarantee.\\xa0 But how did this all happen? And what does it mean for climatetech today? In this episode, Shayle talks to Saloni Multani, partner at Galvanize Climate Solutions and former chief financial officer for Joe Biden’s 2020 campaign. She came on the show last May to explain what the economic downturn meant for climatetech. This time Saloni and Shayle cover topics like:  What led to the problems at SVB, Signature, and others  How trends in the broader banking system signal a new environment for climatetech companies\\xa0  The durability of climatetech opportunities Whether others will fill the hole left by SVB, which was a critical partner to many climatetech projects, including 62% of U.S. community solar projects    Recommended Resources:   The Carbon Copy: A bank collapse threatens climate startups   Canary: Community solar industry says it can ride out Silicon Valley Bank failure   The Guardian: ‘The first Twitter-fuelled bank run’: how social media compounded SVB’s collapse   Catalyst: How will the downturn affect climatetech?

When it leaks from storage, pipes and other infrastructure into the atmosphere, new studies suggest hydrogen absorbs more heat than previously understood. And, perhaps more importantly, it extends the atmospheric life of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Proponents argue that hydrogen is a critical climate solution. “Green” hydrogen, for example, is made with zero-carbon electricity, effectively turning things like solar and wind energy into a storable fuel that can replace natural gas in many end uses. But could hydrogen’s warming impacts outweigh its advantages? That depends on your assumptions about how and where we use it. In this episode, Shayle talks to Thomas Koch Blank, senior principal at RMI, where he leads the organization’s Breakthrough Technology Program. Shayle and Thomas examine the new research and discuss topics like:\\xa0   Where we will use hydrogen and varying risks of leakage in those applications  Poor applications for hydrogen, like\\xa0turning “blue” hydrogen derived from steam methane reforming into synfuel  Estimated leakage rates and the incentives for hydrogen producers to build low-leakage systems  Hydrogen’s total warming impact, factoring in how much natural gas it could replace  How natural gas and hydrogen compare kilogram for kilogram or megajoule for megajoule  The time horizon we should use to evaluate the global warming potential of hydrogen  Hydrogen leakage measurement, verification, and safety   Recommended Resources:   Environmental Defense Fund: Emissions of Hydrogen Could Undermine Its Climate Benefits; Warming Effects Are Two to Six Times Higher Than Previously Thought   RMI: Hydrogen Reality Check #1: Hydrogen Is Not a Significant Warming Risk   Columbia University’s SIPA Center on Global Energy Policy: Hydrogen Leakage: A Potential Risk for the Hydrogen Economy    Click here for a full transcript.

Most of us think of global warming as a long game. How do we reach\\xa0net zero by 2050? And how should we curb carbon dioxide emissions to get there? But the warming happening now and in the next few years is just as important. Short-term warming exacerbates wildfires, hurricanes and other climate impacts now. And the short-term trajectory of warming can make things better or worse in the long run. At some point before we reach net zero emissions, it’s increasingly likely that we will overshoot our 1.5 degree target. Hopefully we will come back down, but the more we overshoot, the worse the effects of climate change will be. Which is why we should bend the curve of that trajectory by tackling the causes of short-term warming. High up on that list is methane. It lives in the atmosphere for only 12 years, but in the 20 years after it reaches the atmosphere it causes about 84 times more warming than carbon dioxide. That means it’s also a powerful solution. Methane in the atmosphere right now causes about 30% of global warming to date, but cutting emissions now would actually have a cooling effect. Why? Because, unlike carbon dioxide which lasts for several hundred years, methane breaks down relatively quickly.\\xa0 So how do we tackle the methane problem? In this episode, Shayle talks to Erika Reinhardt, co-founder of Spark Climate Solutions, a non-profit focused on under-addressed climate solutions. Right now Spark is focusing on methane emissions from livestock, also known as enteric methane.  Shayle and Erika cover topics like:  Why we should consider different time-scale standards for measuring global warming impact, such as GWP100 and GWP20   How short-lived aerosols mask the full warming impact of greenhouse gasses  Methane removal, including the process of oxidation and methane sinks  Different sources of methane, such as wetlands, livestock and fossil fuel production  Ready-to-deploy solutions to fossil fuel methane emissions, such as flaring, detection, capture and storage  How flaring may be less effective than previously thought  Solutions under development for livestock methane, such as manure management, biogas digesters and feed additives like seaweed-derived bromoform\\xa0   Recommended Resources:   Canary: Cutting methane emissions could make a big dent in climate change, major UN report says   Bloomberg: As Gas Prices Soar, Nobody Knows How Much Methane Is Leaking   Inside Climate News: Feeding Cows Seaweed Reduces Their Methane Emissions, but California Farms Are a Long Way From Scaling Up the Practice   Catalyst is a co-production of Post Script Media and Canary Media.

The Inflation Reduction Act is an incredibly important win for climate. It puts the U.S. back on the global stage as a serious climate negotiator. It puts the country within reach of a net-zero grid.

Billions in public and private dollars are lining up to invest in a wave of newly planned hydrogen facilities. EU policymakers are finalizing new regulations and subsidies. And the region’s energy crisis–sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine–has accelerated the need for alternative energy sources like hydrogen.  But an unexpected twist: The U.S. passed the Inflation Reduction Act, with subsidies for hydrogen production and far looser rules than those under consideration in Europe. Could Europe lose its hydrogen competitiveness?  In this episode, Shayle talks to Gniewomir Flis, an independent hydrogen consultant. Previously he researched hydrogen at Agora Energiewende, a decarbonization think tank, and Energy Revolution Venture, a decarbonization venture capital firm.  Gniewomir explains that some in Europe worry the U.S. might become a more attractive place to invest in hydrogen if the EU’s rules are too strict. This concern throws more complexity into an already difficult policy-making process. It’s causing EU policymakers to fight over proposed rules and investors to delay final decisions to greenlight European projects.  Gniewomir and Shayle discuss questions like:   What’s the evidence for the concerns about Europe’s competitiveness?  What counts as renewable hydrogen in the proposed EU rules? They discuss the three key criteria that could be required for subsidies: additionality, temporal correlation and geographic correlation  Which electrolyzer technology—proton exchange membrane (PEM), alkaline, or solid oxide—is best for which power generation technology, such as solar, gas, and wind?  How will the proposed rules impact developing countries’ plans to export hydrogen to Europe?  How do we transport hydrogen? They discuss options, such as metal hydride, ammonia, methanol and liquid (also known as cryogenic) hydrogen.

So which is it? In this episode, Shayle talks to Sam Jaffe, vice president of battery solutions at E-Source, about the key provisions of the IRA’s EV and battery tax credits. Sam explains how the IRA will spur a North American EV battery supply chain in the long run but will also create winners and losers along the way.\\xa0 There’s a $30 billion pot of money for various tax credits and limited time to make use of them. Who will get to it first? There are already some early movers. Sam explains the key provisions:  The EV components tax credit reduces the cost of EVs whose batteries contain materials assembled in the U.S. or its free-trade partner countries. This includes electrodes, electrolyte components and cells.\\xa0  The strategic minerals tax credit reduces the cost of EVs whose batteries contain minerals mined and processed in the U.S. or its free-trade partner countries. These minerals include lithium, cobalt, and rare earth metals, among others.  The 45X advanced manufacturing production credit reduces the cost of making batteries in the U.S.  Certain credits ratchet up the percentage of materials required to qualify over several years. So once an EV model qualifies, it will have to maintain eligibility by getting a larger and larger share of its components and minerals from approved countries.   They also cover which part of the battery industry will benefit more– the EV battery side or the stationary storage side. And Sam explains why he’s paying attention to the Treasury Department’s forthcoming guidance on the tax credits.

The energy crisis that is afflicting Europe and other parts of the world is worsening as Russia weaponizes natural gas. This energy crisis has effects across climate tech, and so today we’re bringing you an episode of Columbia Energy Exchange, a podcast from Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. On Catalyst, we don’t usually dig so deep into geopolitics and policy, but this crisis has big implications for markets, investment and technology.\\xa0 After Russian President Vladimir Putin turned off supply of Russian gas through the Nord Stream pipeline earlier this month, prices across Europe soared – causing severe pain for manufacturers and consumers, and pushing the region closer to recession. European countries are weighing emergency measures, like price caps and rationing. In addition to the immediate energy crisis, key questions remain about what all of this means for the clean energy transition. The supply of critical materials for clean energy technologies – such as copper, lithium, and cobalt – will also present challenges. A recent report by S&P Global predicted that demand for copper will double by 2035 as a consequence of the energy transition, and it is unclear if the existing supply chains can sustain such an increase.\\xa0 How can governments and companies address the energy crisis without sacrificing progress on climate? And how might current and future supply shortages change the geopolitical landscape? This week, Columbia Energy Exchange host Jason Bordoff talks with Dr. Dan Yergin, an internationally known authority on energy, geopolitics, and economics. He sits on the boards of numerous institutions – including Columbia’s Center of Global Energy Policy. Dr. Yergin is the Pulitzer Prize winning author of “The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money & Power.” And his most recent book, “The New Map: Energy, Climate, and the Clash of Nations,” illustrates the greatest issues of geopolitics and energy today.\\xa0 He is the Vice Chairman of S&P Global, and was the project Chairman for the report, “The Future of Copper: Will the looming supply gap short-circuit the energy transition?” Jason spoke with Dr. Yergin about the ongoing energy crisis, the supply of critical materials, and the future of energy superpowers.

But the market for soil carbon credits—literally paying farmers to improve their practices—needs serious reform.\\xa0\\xa0 In this episode, Shayle talks with Freya Chay, program manager for carbon removal at CarbonPlan. The fundamental problem is that the existing carbon credits don’t do what they say they will do: permanently lock away additional carbon. Freya and Shayle survey the big challenges of the market and explore potential fixes, covering questions like:  How do we measure—using models, samplings and satellites—the amount of carbon in a plot of soil?  What tools do we have to make sure the carbon will stay in the ground, such as buffer pools and ton-year accounting?  The additionality question: Without the credit, would the carbon have been captured anyway? Or would it have remained locked away anyway?

But years of destructive farming practices have released much of this carbon. Could incentivizing farmers help restore—and expand—soil’s\\xa0carbon-carrying capacity?\\xa0</p><p>In theory, yes.

The fundamental problem is that the existing carbon credits don’t do what they say they will do: permanently lock away additional carbon. Freya and Shayle survey the big challenges of the market and explore potential fixes, covering questions like:</p><ul><li>How do we measure—using models, samplings and satellites—the amount of carbon in a plot of soil?</li><li>What tools do we have to make sure the carbon will stay in the ground, such as buffer pools and ton-year accounting?</li><li>The additionality question: Without the credit, would the carbon have been captured anyway?

It's an episode of one of our favorite podcasts, called Watt It Takes hosted by Emily Kirsch of Powerhouse Ventures.\\xa0  We talk a lot on Catalyst about how to finance and build climatetech. What we don’t always get into are the personal stories of people who are trying to do that work.  That’s exactly what Watt It Takes does. The show tells the stories of founders who are building a zero-carbon world — their upbringings, their risks, their failures, and their breakthroughs.  This episode is about Neha Palmer, CEO of TeraWatt Infrastructure, which builds large-scale electric vehicle charging hubs for medium and heavy transport.  Tens of millions of delivery vans and semi trucks move around the clock to keep supply chains humming. These medium- and heavy-duty vehicles make up more than 25 percent of transportation emissions in the US — even though they only make up 10 percent of all vehicles on the road.  We need to electrify medium and heavy-duty vehicles to meet our climate goals. But, how do we build and operate the charging infrastructure to power them?  That charging network is exactly what TeraWatt Infrastructure is building.  TeraWatt develops, owns, and manages charging infrastructure for these large vehicles. The company integrates hardware, software, and grid services along with on-site chargers. TerraWatt has a growing portfolio of land in strategic locations across the country that enables it to build and operate that charging infrastructure.  TeraWatt brings together a team of experts from data centers, transportation logistics, and electric cars. The more complex the high-powered charging needs, the better suited TeraWatt is for the task.  Watt It Takes host Emily Kirsch sat down with Neha to learn what it takes to electrify a sector with such massive energy demand. They talked about founding TeraWatt after Neha left Google, where she was a key figure in that company's ambitious renewable energy strategy.

It would last a million miles and cost less than anything produced today. So in the booming EV battery market, what kind of battery will check all those boxes? Who will invent it? And do we really need all those features in one battery in the first place? In this episode, Shayle talks to Sam Jaffe, vice president of battery solutions at E-Source. They trace the history of the two major competing lithium-ion chemistries: Lithium Iron (or ferrous) Phosphate (LFP) and Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC). Sam and Shayle also discuss the factors that shaped this competition, like China, Tesla, and access to capital. They discuss new partnerships between battery manufacturers and automakers, including LG and GM, Samsung SDI and Stellantis, ACC and Mercedes And they cover questions like:  Who decides which chemistries to develop — automakers or battery part manufacturers?\\xa0  Will a small number of chemistries dominate or will there be a rapid diversification of battery chemistries to meet different needs?  Is fast charging a nice-to-have or need-to-have?  Will the rising costs of battery materials, especially lithium, slow the adoption of EVs?\\xa0  Plus, Sam explains why he is no longer bearish on vehicle-to-grid (V2G) charging.

In this episode, Lara Pierpoint, director of climate at Actuate, and Stephen Lacey, host of The Carbon Copy and executive producer of Catalyst, join Shayle for a game of\\xa0“buy sell hold.” They take\\xa0bets on which technologies are either overhyped, underhyped or just right. They cover a range of topics, including:   Advanced nuclear, including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s rejection of Oklo’s reactor designs and shifting opinions around nuclear   Whether the concern around hydrogen leakage and its greenhouse effect is overblown  Heat pumps, including the Biden administration’s efforts to boost production with the National Defense Production Act and a new report on how a proposed federal program to incentivize heat pumps could save Americans over $27 billion  Non-lithium-ion batteries for stationary storage, which may see an opening in the market as lithium-ion batteries become expensive due to rising commodity prices and backedup supply chains.  The state of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technologies and fleet electrification   Battery recycling, which is picking up speed due to concerns about the environmental impact of production and a shortage of materials  Whether web3- and crypto-climate startups are solving the right problem   Catalyst is brought to you by Arcadia.

For example, a rooftop solar company needs consumer energy data to analyze bill savings from a potential solar installation. An electric vehicle (EV) charging company needs it to offer a customer special rates on EV charging. But that data has long been incredibly difficult to access – available only in PDFs and hard-to-access utility databases – often coming in very different formats and standards. And yet companies are trying to overcome these challenges by bringing that data into easy-to-use interfaces. Arcadia is one such company. Earlier this month it raised $200 million, an investment that valued the company at $1.5 billion.

EIP led the company's Series A and has invested in every round since. Arcadia is a sponsor of this podcast. Kiran is also a friend of Shayle’s, and Shayle is an Arcadia customer. Shayle and Kiran discuss key questions about consumer data, such as:  What are the most valuable data points? Kiran and Shayle talk about grid carbon intensity, on-time bill payments and more.  What level of fidelity do we need from the data? Do we need precise real-time data to prove savings to customers and support higher DER sales, or will high-level estimates suffice?  Do we need an ever-expanding pool of smart devices, or can we unlock most of the value with a few key devices, such as a hot water heater, heat pump and EV charger?  How do you develop a moat that protects you from competitors in the consumer data space?  What could the future of the DER market look like? Kiran argues that DER providers will shift from selling widgets to selling platforms and packages as whole-home managers.

The project, called Advanced Clean Energy Storage (ACES), will generate hydrogen from renewables and store it deep underground in what’s called a salt dome. ACES will use that stored hydrogen to generate electricity in a hybrid power plant, running on both natural gas and hydrogen. ACES is one of the many planned hydrogen hubs in the U.S., and once completed it would be one of the largest in the country. The loan will finance an initial 220 megawatts of hydrogen production and 300 gigawatt hours of storage. What did it take to put this deal together, and what does it say about the future of hydrogen hubs more broadly? In this episode, Shayle talks to Jigar Shah, director of the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office (LPO) about the project. The LPO is the government agency behind the conditional loan guarantee. Shayle and Jigar talk about what made this particular project attractive to the LPO. They talk about why the salt dome storage was essential to making the project work, and the other uses for hydrogen beyond power, such as a feedstock for ammonia production and other heavy industries. They also break down the difficulties in transporting hydrogen and the need to site hydrogen production near consumption. Catalyst is brought to you by Arcadia.

The loan will finance an initial 220 megawatts of hydrogen production and 300 gigawatt hours of storage.</p><p>What did it take to put this deal together, and what does it say about the future of hydrogen hubs more broadly?</p><p>In this episode, Shayle talks to <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/lpo/person/jigar-shah\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jigar Shah</a>, director of the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office (LPO) about the project. The LPO is the government agency behind the conditional loan guarantee.</p><p>Shayle and Jigar talk about what made this particular project attractive to the LPO. They talk about why the salt dome storage was essential to making the project work, and the other uses for hydrogen beyond power, such as a feedstock for ammonia production and other heavy industries. They also break down the difficulties in transporting hydrogen and the need to site hydrogen production near consumption.</p><p>Catalyst is brought to you by Arcadia.

But does it have to be that way? Could\\xa0we deploy scaleable reactors that are cheaper, safer, and that produce less waste? Advanced nuclear startups in the U.S. certainly think so.\\xa0 In this episode, guest host Lara Pierpoint speaks with Jake DeWitte, co-founder and CEO of Oklo, one of many advanced nuclear companies that have emerged in recent years. Lara and Jake survey the polarized landscape of nuclear development, with many countries shutting down plants and others planning to open new ones. They discuss the main problems with traditional nuclear, and examine some new ways companies are attempting to solve them.\\xa0 They focus on the technologies that Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) and microreactors could use, including liquid metal, liquid salt, and gas-cooled options, as well as fast reactors. They also talk about nuclear waste recycling, safer self-cooling designs, and nuclear direct heating. Lara asks: Can advanced nuclear reactors scale in time to make a dent in global emissions? Jake says, in the medium term, yes. To get there, he says we need to build reactors like we build cars, planes, and wind turbines: by simplifying designs, pre-fabricating modules and taking advantage of existing supply chains. This modular approach could open up new business models, like nuclear as a service, and new financing options, like the power purchase agreements common in renewable energy.\\xa0 But how will regulators respond? Just recently the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission rejected Oklo’s application to build and operate the company’s Aurora compact fast reactor in Idaho.

But does it have to be that way? Could\\xa0we deploy scaleable reactors that are cheaper, safer, and that produce less waste? Advanced nuclear startups in the U.S. certainly think so.\\xa0</p><p>In this episode, guest host <a href=\"https://actuateinnovation.org/about/lara-pierpoint/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lara Pierpoint</a> speaks with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-dewitte-90062132\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jake DeWitte</a>, co-founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://oklo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oklo</a>, one of many advanced nuclear companies that have emerged in recent years.</p><p>Lara and Jake survey the polarized landscape of nuclear development, with many countries shutting down plants and others planning to open new ones. They discuss the main problems with traditional nuclear, and examine some new ways companies are attempting to solve them.\\xa0</p><p>They focus on the technologies that Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) and microreactors could use, including <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_metal_cooled_reactor\" rel=\"nofollow\">liquid metal</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molten_salt_reactor\" rel=\"nofollow\">liquid salt</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas-cooled_reactor\" rel=\"nofollow\">gas-cooled</a> options, as well as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast-neutron_reactor\" rel=\"nofollow\">fast reactors</a>. They also talk about nuclear waste recycling, safer self-cooling designs, and nuclear direct heating.</p><p>Lara asks: Can advanced nuclear reactors scale in time to make a dent in global emissions? Jake says, in the medium term, yes. To get there, he says we need to build reactors like we build cars, planes, and wind turbines: by simplifying designs, pre-fabricating modules and taking advantage of existing supply chains. This modular approach could open up new business models, like nuclear as a service, and new financing options, like the power purchase agreements common in renewable energy.\\xa0</p><p>But how will regulators respond? Just recently the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission <a href=\"https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/nuclear/nuclear-startup-oklo-gets-thumbs-down-from-regulators-what-does-this-mean-for-next-gen-nuclear\" rel=\"nofollow\">rejected</a> Oklo’s application to build and operate the company’s Aurora compact fast reactor in Idaho.

So how do we build it?</p><p>Shayle addresses that question with\\xa0<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nan-ransohoff-50132a21/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nan Ransohoff</a>, Stripe’s head of climate. Shayle and Nan break down lessons from Stripe’s first two carbon-removal portfolios.</p><p>They discuss whether carbon removal will become a commodity market. They also cover learning curves, the sources of demand and the parallels between carbon removal and vaccine development.</p><p>And Shayle asks: What does a winner look like? Will a single technology dominate?</p><p>Catalyst\\xa0is a co-production of\\xa0<a href=\"https://postscriptmedia.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Post Script Media</a>\\xa0and\\xa0<a href=\"https://www.canarymedia.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Canary Media</a>.</p><p>Catalyst\\xa0is supported by Atmos Financial.

Case in point: The 2016 MIT report Venture Capital and Cleantech: The Wrong Model for Clean Energy Innovation by Ben Gaddy and Varun Sivaram.
