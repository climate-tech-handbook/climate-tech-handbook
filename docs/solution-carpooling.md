## Progress Made

1. **App-based Services**: Technologies like Uber, Lyft, and Waze have made carpooling more convenient and accessible.
2. **HOV Lanes**: High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes incentivize carpooling, reducing congestion and emissions.
3. **Corporate Initiatives**: Many companies now offer carpooling programs and incentives for employees.
