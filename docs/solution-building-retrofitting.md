## Overview

Building retrofitting involves enhancing existing buildings to be more energy-efficient and reduce their carbon impact, achieved through methods such as insulation, energy-efficient windows, and upgraded heating/cooling systems. Technological advances, such as energy-efficient windows and aerogel insulation, have driven progress in this field.

## Progress Made

- Thermal insulation, energy-efficient windows, and green roofs.

- Notable contributors include Building Decarbonization Coalition, the U.S. Green Building Council, among others.

## Lessons Learned

Key insights from the development and implementation of Building Retrofitting to reverse climate change include:

1. **Comprehensive Planning**: An all-encompassing plan is essential, aiming for optimal energy efficiency and carbon reduction while minimizing expenses.
2. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Involving all parties, from building owners to government officials, is crucial during planning and execution.
3. **Financing Variety**: Exploring diverse financing options, such as private investment, government incentives, and utility rebates, can make retrofitting more affordable.
4. **Holistic Approach**: The most successful retrofitting projects address both physical and operational aspects of buildings.
5. **Part of Broader Effort**: Retrofitting's impact in reducing emissions is significant but must align with broader decarbonization strategies.

## Challenges Ahead

Major challenges remaining in Building Retrofitting for climate change reversal are:

1. **High Costs**: The substantial expenses associated with retrofit projects often discourage adoption, especially for residential properties and smaller businesses.
2. **Awareness Gap**: Lack of awareness about retrofitting's benefits hinders its widespread adoption.
3. **Skilled Personnel**: A shortage of trained professionals qualified for retrofitting projects can lead to suboptimal results.

## Best Path Forward

While the optimal path forward for Building Retrofitting may vary based on community specifics, some general best practices include:

1. **Clear Goals**: Set clear retrofitting goals aligned with climate change mitigation objectives.
2. **Stakeholder Involvement**: Engage building owners, occupants, and local government in the planning and design phases.
3. **Comprehensive Audit**: Conduct an energy audit to identify potential retrofit measures.
4. **Appropriate Measures**: Select retrofit actions suitable for the building and climate, prioritizing energy savings and emission reductions.
5. **Phased Implementation**: Gradually implement retrofit measures, starting with cost-effective options.
6. **Evaluation and Sharing**: Continuously monitor results and share insights to aid other communities.
