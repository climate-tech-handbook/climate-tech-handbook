- **People are suffering** - [5 million deaths per year](https://www.sciencealert.com/abnormal-temperatures-could-already-account-for-5-million-deaths-a-year) and [billions of economic damage](https://www.npr.org/2023/11/14/1206506962/climate-change-affects-your-life-in-3-big-ways-a-new-report-warns) already.
