You don’t have to find one…you can MAKE one. Drew Wilkinson was a punk rocker and eco-pirate when he landed a job as a paralegal at Microsoft. He felt like a fish out of water in the corporate tech world, but instead of changing his DIY-contrarian tune, Drew leaned in. Though “sustainability” wasn’t in his job description, Drew co-founded a powerful employee sustainability community. It would grow to the thousands, stretch across the globe, and push Microsoft to use their billions to do better for the planet. 

In the first episode of Degrees Season 6: How to Green Your Job, Drew’s story is a top-notch lesson in forging your way into a planet-saving career. He took what he already knew how to do — disrupt a system, innovate solutions, and organize folks around him — and applied it to greening his workplace. Now, he’s taking his climate solutions work outside the walls of Microsoft and working independently to help organizations become more sustainable through employee-led solutions, and make sustainability part of everybody’s job.",How a punk-rocking paralegal harnessed employee power to green Microsoft

Frank learned from his Yurok and Karuk family the cultural practice of setting fires to prevent blazes. He is at the heart of a conflict that’s raged for more than a century: Is all fire bad? Can we use fire for good? How?

Jobs to address wildfires could include lots of career paths. What skills do you need? In the field, they need people who can run bulldozers to suppress fires, or harvest logs with a skid-steer. They also need wildlife biologists and hydrologists to understand how fire impacts whole ecosystems. And there’s a whole new field incorporating new technologies into wildfire -- which can work with Traditional Ecological Knowledge. 

Frank Kanawha Lank notes, “I see this as an emergent field for a lot of young Native people who have traditional teachings and upbringings like I have, but who are also getting the Western academic training in remote sensing, GIS and modeling. So there's a way of looking at an actual fire event, how it's burning and what's going on for fire behavior. There's also the more remote sensing level of looking at that fire or a complex of fires in an area, that helps you assess the vegetation or to fuel loading and the risks to community or the benefits of where fire could be applied.” 

He added, “The work I do as a scientist, the work I do as a practitioner in managing or stewarding the environment for foods, for medicines, thinking about the fish and water, going to those high mountain springs to check in on them. Each and every one of us have a form of responsibility that we use today, to start and plant a seed. It's not going to happen overnight. It's going to happen in generations.
