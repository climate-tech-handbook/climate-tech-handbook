#### LEVEL 1 means

**You:**

* You are committed to being a climate worker for at least the next 5 years. That's when we will hit 1.5C and we **absolutely must** start drawing down greenhouse pollution every year until we hit net zero by 2050
<!-- insert link to definition of 1.5C, net zero, and 2050-->

* Your job search isn't going great and you are feeling "imposter syndrome"

* You aren't sure which general sector or specific [climate solution](solutions) you want to focus on yet
