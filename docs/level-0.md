## Important Criteria

#### Definition of LEVEL 1 and LEVEL 2

:::note LEVEL 1
### 👉 [Skip ahead to LEVEL 1](level-1)

### ⚠️ ONLY IF you are past   [LEVEL 0](#definition-of-level-0) 👆

---

#### LEVEL 1 means

**You:**

* You are committed to being a climate worker for at least the next 5 years. That's when we will hit 1.5C and we **absolutely must** start drawing down greenhouse pollution every year until we hit net zero by 2050
<!-- insert link to definition of 1.5C, net zero, and 2050-->

* Your job search isn't going great and you are feeling "imposter syndrome"

* You aren't sure which general sector or specific [climate solution](solutions) you want to focus on yet

:::
:::note LEVEL 2
### 👉 [Skip ahead to LEVEL 2](level-2)

### ⚠️ ONLY IF you are past   [LEVEL 1](level-0#%EF%B8%8F-start-here) 👆

---

#### LEVEL 2 means
* a

* b

* c

#### We are almost ready to [start the lesson](#lesson-start) for LEVEL 0 but first:

:::caution Important note for those who are struggling with specialized experience.

The tech world is a bit like Hollywood.

It's extremely competitive with millions of people clamoring to get a piece of the 🇺🇸 American Dream™.

You may feel frustrated and ready to give up.

Every job description wants a minimum of 3-5 years of specialized experience that you don't have.

**This problem is especially rampant in climate tech**.

Climate tech is a world of high risk early startups with founders and hiring managers who are under pressure to draft the best possible "talent" into the climate arena.

### 😩 We feel your pain and are here to help

#### If you want to shrink 3 years of requred experience down to 3 months building a real world portfolio.

The Climate Tech Handbook is completely [open source](contribute).

You can join us on Slack and prove to the world that you're ready.
