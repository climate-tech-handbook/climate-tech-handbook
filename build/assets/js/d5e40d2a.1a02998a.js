According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the total global land area suitable for cultivation is 12 billion hectares, but only 4 billion hectares are currently being used for crops and pasture (1). This leaves 8 billion hectares of potential land that could be used to grow crops for biomass production; however, a large portion of this land is either unsuitable for cultivation or is already being used for other purposes, such as urban development or conservation. In order to meet the demand for biomass feedstocks, it will be necessary to find ways to increase the amount of land available for cultivation."}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.li,{children:"Another challenge that needs to be addressed is the issue of water availability. Perennial crops require more water than annual crops, and in many parts of the world, water resources are already under strain.
