The production of cement is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for approximately 8% of global emissions. As the world looks to reduce its emissions in order to reverse climate change, the development of alternative cements has been a major focus.

## Environmental Impact

- Traditional Portland cement production is highly energy-intensive and emits a significant amount of CO2.
- Alternative cements can utilize industrial by-products, reducing waste and emissions.
- Energy-efficient production processes can further reduce the carbon footprint.

## Solutions by Sector

### Production
- **Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)**: Captures CO2 emissions from cement production and stores them underground.
- **Alternative Materials**: Using materials like fly ash, slag, and rice husk ash in cement production.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Developing more energy-efficient cement production processes.

**Case Studies:**
1. **CarbonCure Technologies**: Uses CO2 captured from industrial processes to cure concrete, reducing its carbon footprint ([CarbonCure](https://www.carboncure.com)).
2. **CEMEX**: Implemented CCS technology in cement plants, capturing up to 1 million tons of CO2 annually ([CEMEX](https://www.cemex.com)).
3. **HeidelbergCement**: Developed a carbon-neutral cement using alternative materials and CCS ([HeidelbergCement](https://www.heidelbergcement.com)).

### Distribution
- **Low-Carbon Transport**: Using electric or hydrogen-powered vehicles to transport cement.
- **Efficient Logistics**: Optimizing supply chains to reduce emissions from transport.
- **Local Production**: Establishing local production facilities to minimize transport distances.

**Case Studies:**
1. **LafargeHolcim**: Implemented a low-carbon transport strategy using electric trucks for cement distribution ([LafargeHolcim](https://www.lafargeholcim.com)).
2. **Fortera**: Established local production units to reduce transport emissions ([Fortera](https://forteraglobal.com)).
3. **Prometheus Materials**: Uses local materials and production to minimize the carbon footprint of distribution ([Prometheus Materials](https://prometheusmaterials.com)).

### Consumption
- **Green Building Standards**: Promoting the use of alternative cements in green building certifications.
