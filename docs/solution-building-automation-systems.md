Building Automation Systems (BAS) are crucial for optimizing energy use and reducing emissions in buildings. By integrating various systems such as heating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC), lighting, and security, BAS can significantly enhance energy efficiency and occupant comfort.

These systems use sensors, controllers, and software to monitor and manage building systems.
