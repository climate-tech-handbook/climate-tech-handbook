## Overview

**Small Hydropower** development has notably contributed to greenhouse gas emission reduction through innovations like **micro-hydro turbines**. These efficient turbines find applications in diverse settings, including remote villages lacking grid power. Examples also include using hydropower for irrigation and electricity generation, both mitigating reliance on fossil fuels. Leading in small hydropower development are organizations such as the **International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)**, the **United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)**, and the **World Bank**.

## Progress Made

- **Development of small hydropower plants** for electricity generation.
- **U.S. Department of Energy**, the **National Renewable Energy Laboratory**, and the **Electric Power Research Institute**: Pioneering contributors to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions through clean electricity.
 
## Lessons Learned

1. **Small hydropower is a crucial renewable energy source** combating climate change.
2. **Cost-effectiveness**: Often competitive levelized costs of electricity (LCOE) compared to other renewables.
3. Contributes to **grid stability and flexibility**, aiding integration of higher shares of renewable energy.
4. **Environmental and social considerations**: Careful planning and stakeholder engagement crucial for success.

Prominent contributors in small hydropower development include the **International Hydropower Association (IHA)**, the **Small Hydropower Association (SHPA)**, and various national/regional hydropower associations.

## Challenges Ahead

- **Cost barriers**: High expenses, particularly challenging in developing nations.
- **Technical hurdles**: Novelty of technology involves significant technical challenges.
- **Environmental impacts**: Alterations to hydrology, habitat loss, and community displacement.

**Public-private partnerships** can address cost hurdles. For instance, the **World Bank** collaborates with governments and the private sector in countries like Nepal, Pakistan, and Vietnam. Innovations like **Blue Energy**'s Swiss hydropower plant costing under $1,000 are helping make the technology affordable. **IRENA** and the **UNDP** work on the technical challenges via research and capacity building.

Balancing the benefits and potential environmental impacts of small hydropower is crucial. **Environmental assessments** are essential to minimize negative effects.

## Best Path Forward

To effectively address climate change through small hydropower, key steps include:

1. **Raising awareness** about small hydropower's potential.
2. Enhancing **affordability and accessibility** of small hydropower.
3. Improving **system efficiency** of small hydropower setups.
4. **Supporting research and development** for small hydropower technologies.

Leading contributors in small hydropower development and promotion include the **International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)**, the **United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)**, and the **World Bank**.
