Securing land tenure for Indigenous Peoples is essential for sustainable forest management, biodiversity conservation, and climate change mitigation.

Indigenous peoples play a crucial role in environmental conservation. They make up around 5% of the global population but occupy, own, or manage approximately 25% of the world’s land surface (including about 40% of all terrestrial protected areas) and hold 80% of the planet’s biodiversity (Garnett et al., [2018](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1745-5871.12610#geor12610-bib-0017))

## Progress Made

Significant advancements have been made in securing Indigenous Peoples' forest tenure:

1. **Technological Advancements**: Use of satellite imagery, drones, and GIS in forest management.
2. **Carbon Offsetting**: Developed to reduce emissions and support Indigenous land rights.
3. **Investments**: Businesses offset emissions by investing in projects like wind farms and forest conservation.

Key organizations supporting these initiatives include:

- **Forest Carbon Partnership Facility** (a World Bank initiative)
- **World Bank**
- **Global Forest Watch**

## Solutions by Sector

3. **World Bank**: Funds projects that support Indigenous land rights and sustainable forest management ([World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org)).

## Lessons Learned

1. **Indigenous Voice**: Essential in decision-making about forest tenure.
2. **Capacity Building**: Crucial to empower Indigenous communities for effective forest management.
3. **Financing**: Long-term financial commitments required, including innovative mechanisms like carbon offsetting.
4. **Awareness**: Necessity to spread knowledge about Indigenous forest tenure initiatives.
5. **Collaborative Efforts**: Success depends on collaboration among governments, NGOs, and Indigenous communities.

## Challenges Ahead

1. **Awareness Gap**: Both among Indigenous Peoples and policymakers.
2. **Support Lacking**: Financial and technical support for Indigenous-led forest tenure systems.
3. **Research Needed**: Effectiveness of various forest tenure types.
4. **Policy Implementation**: Ensuring policies are effectively implemented and enforced.

## Best Path Forward

1. **Traditional Knowledge**: Invest in Indigenous knowledge for sustainable forest management.
2. **Community Capacity**: Enhance Indigenous communities' ability to manage their forest tenure systems.
3. **Awareness and Training**: Continued efforts needed to make Indigenous forest tenure widespread.
4. **Financial Incentives**: Provide financial support for sustainable forest management practices.
5. **Policy Support**: Implement policies that recognize and protect Indigenous land rights.
