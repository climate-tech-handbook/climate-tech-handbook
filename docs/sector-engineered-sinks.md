## Sector Overview

There are plenty of startups working to engineer non-nature solutions to capture carbon.

However, Project Drawdown has only assessed biochar, which is ready today and its feasible to scale.

There are plenty of startups working to engineer solutions to capture carbon beyond [Land Sinks](sector-land-sinks) or [Coastal and Ocean Sinks](sector-coastal-and-ocean-sinks)

Keep in mind that some of these solutions are hotly debated for various reason.

For example, [Project Drawdown](level-1#project-drawdown) has only assessed biochar, because they consider it ready today and is feasible to scale.
