## Overview

- By reducing worldwide cattle numbers, we can achieve immediate climate gains due to methane's short half-life. Additionally, industrial livestock reduction prevents destruction of biodiverse habitat that are ideal [land sinks](../sector-land-sinks).
- Beef is more [resource-intensive](https://www.wri.org/insights/6-pressing-questions-about-beef-and-climate-change-answered) than other meats, and animal-based foods require more resources than plant-based foods.
- Shifting towards plant-based diets offers the greatest potential for positive impact, surpassing increased yields, agricultural efficiency, and reduced food waste.

Food design technologies are revolutionizing plant-based options, enhancing taste and aroma. Advancements like extrudable fat technology, introducing new food resources, and climate-first supply chain technologies are transforming the way we eat. Embracing these innovations allows us to make sustainable choices for a healthier future.

Here are the [latest technology](https://gfi.org/science/the-science-of-plant-based-meat/) developments:

* Lab-grown meat (CBM): Stem cells from animal biopsy are grown in bioreactors to form muscle, fat, and connective tissue for meat production.
* Plant- and fungi-based meat (PBM): Plant ingredients undergo sourcing, processing, and formulation stages to replace functional components in animal products through R&D.
* Recreate products have a low background flavor: The goal is to maintain a low background flavor in products without overpowering the subtler tastes of conventional meat or seafood.

## Lessons Learned

* Plant-based non-vegetarian alternatives market on the rise due to animal-borne infection risks, health concerns, and demand for good food commodities.
* Growing public understanding and demand for plant-based alternatives driven by health benefits and appeal to flexitarians.
* Increasing awareness of food system's climate impact influencing consumer purchasing decisions.
* [50%](https://www.unilever.com/news/news-search/2023/five-trends-that-will-take-plantbased-eating-mainstream-in-2023/) of flexitarians interested in following food trends.
* [42%](https://www.unilever.com/news/news-search/2023/five-trends-that-will-take-plantbased-eating-mainstream-in-2023/) of consumers worldwide expect plant-based foods to replace meat in the next decade.

## Challenges Ahead

* Plant-based meat industry growth limited by population sensitivity to soy and gluten and high prices.
* Incorrect perception of taste of plant-based beef products can hinder market expansion.
* Plant-based meat is significantly more expensive than conventional meat on a per-pound basis, according to Nielsen data.
* [Analysts](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/15/business/beyond-meat-impossible-emissions.html) find it challenging to assess the sustainability of plant-based foods due to limited transparency regarding emissions.

## Best Path Forward

The future of plant-based foods in the restaurant industry appears promising as the demand for such options grows. 

* Growing adoption of plant-based diets driven by health, environmental, and ethical considerations.
* Restaurants adapting and expanding plant-based options to meet the increasing demand.
