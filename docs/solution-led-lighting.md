## Progress Made

Since the inception of the first light-emitting diode (LED) in 1907, remarkable progress has transpired in utilizing LED lighting to combat climate change. By 2018, LEDs were estimated to have spared 140 million metric tons of CO2, equivalent to a year's emissions from 30 million cars.

Key advancements include:
1. **Enhanced Efficiency**: LEDs require only 10% of the energy consumed by incandescent bulbs for the same light output.
2. **Precise Light Control**: LEDs offer directed illumination, diminishing the need for overall artificial lighting.
3. **Extended Lifespan**: LEDs can function up to 100,000 hours, reducing replacement frequency.
