## Overview

Biochar is a carbon-rich material produced by heating organic matter in a low-oxygen environment, a process called pyrolysis. It retains most of the carbon produced by decomposing biomass, effectively sequestering it for long periods when added to soil.

2. Matching biochar type with soil and crop needs is essential for improving fertility and yields.
3. Ensuring uncontaminated biochar is crucial when using it for air and water pollutant adsorption.
4. Standardization and quality control are important for consistent biochar performance.

## Challenges Ahead

1. Lack of standardized biochar definition hampers comparison and reliable impact assessment.
2. Limited data on long-term soil and plant effects, as well as potential environmental contamination.
3. Insufficient infrastructure and technical expertise hinder scalability and dissemination.
4. High production costs and lack of established markets for biochar products.

## Best Path Forward
