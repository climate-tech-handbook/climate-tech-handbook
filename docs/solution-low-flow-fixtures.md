## Overview

Hot water is responsible for a quarter of residential energy use worldwide.

More efficient fixtures and appliances can reduce home water use, thereby reducing emissions

## Progress Made

- **Low-flow showerheads, toilets, and faucets**: Remarkable breakthroughs curbing water use by up to 50% and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
- **Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)**: Advocating and promoting the adoption of efficient low-flow fixtures.

## Lessons Learned

**Water savings**: this is a great way to incentivize new adoption by lowering water bills in addition to mitigating greenhouse emissions.

## Challenges Ahead

- **Efficient fixtures**: Overcoming inefficiencies in the market, aiming for optimal water savings.
- **Awareness gap**: Raising public awareness about the ecological and climate benefits of low-flow fixtures.
- **Incentives**: Establishing financial motivations, like tax breaks or rebates, for individuals and businesses to adopt low-flow fixtures.

Notable organizations at the forefront of this cause are **WaterSense** (a program by EPA), the **Alliance for Water Efficiency**, and the **International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials (IAPMO)**.

## Best Path Forward

- **Increasing awareness**: Educational campaigns showcasing water and cost savings.
- **Providing incentives**: Offering financial benefits like tax breaks or rebates.
- **Enhancing availability**: Collaborating with manufacturers to boost production or accessibility through retailers and stores.
