Now that it has been established why climate jobs matter and how this handbook/mini-course will aid in your finding of a climate solution and company that solves it, it is time to learn how this mini-course is set up the way it is!


## How is this course set up?
#### Climate Tech Handbook’s uses the Dream Climate Job System to get you to your climate tech job!

:::note **Dream Climate Job System:**

1. **Choose a climate solution** (you will complete this in Level 2).
2. **Select 10 companies** working on that climate solution (you will do this in Level 3).
3. **Build your portfolio** and network (you will do this in Level 3).
:::

Our model is loosely based on [Austin Belcak’s Dream Job System](https://cultivatedculture.com/djs-podcast/).
