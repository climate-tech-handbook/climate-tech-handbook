## Overview

Over the past decade, there has been significant progress made in developing perennial biomass production to reverse climate change. Breakthrough technologies such as cellulosic ethanol and algae-based biofuels have been developed and have contributed to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Companies such as LanzaTech and Solazyme have been at the forefront of this solution, developing innovative technologies that are making a significant impact in the fight against climate change.

## Progress Made

In the last decade, there has been significant progress in developing perennial biomass production to reverse climate change. Breakthrough technologies such as genetic engineering, nanotechnology, and synthetic biology have contributed to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Companies such as Monsanto, DuPont, and Syngenta have been at the forefront of this solution.

## Lessons Learned

Perennial biomass production is a promising technology for reversing climate change, but there are still many challenges associated with its development and implementation. One of the key lessons learned is that it is important to choose the right location for perennial biomass production. The climate and soil conditions in the chosen location must be suitable for the growth of the desired plants. Another lesson learned is that perennial biomass production requires a significant amount of land and water. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the environmental impact of this technology before implementing it on a large scale.

One of the challenges associated with perennial biomass production is that it is difficult to find suitable locations for cultivation. The climate and soil conditions in many parts of the world are not conducive to the growth of the desired plants. In addition, perennial biomass production requires a large amount of land and water. This can lead to environmental problems such as deforestation and water shortages.

Despite these challenges, there have been some successes associated with the development and implementation of perennial biomass production. For example, in the United States, the Department of Energy has been working on a project to develop perennial grasses that can be used for biofuel production. The goal of the project is to create a sustainable, renewable source of energy that does not compete with food production. In addition, a number of companies and organizations have been working on developing alternative sources of energy that do not rely on fossil fuels. These efforts suggest that it is possible to develop and implement perennial biomass production on a large scale.

## Challenges Ahead

1. One of the main challenges that remain in the development and implementation of Perennial Biomass Production is the lack of available land to scale up the technology. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the total global land area suitable for cultivation is 12 billion hectares, but only 4 billion hectares are currently being used for crops and pasture (1). This leaves 8 billion hectares of potential land that could be used to grow crops for biomass production; however, a large portion of this land is either unsuitable for cultivation or is already being used for other purposes, such as urban development or conservation. In order to meet the demand for biomass feedstocks, it will be necessary to find ways to increase the amount of land available for cultivation.
2. Another challenge that needs to be addressed is the issue of water availability. Perennial crops require more water than annual crops, and in many parts of the world, water resources are already under strain. According to the World Water Council, by 2025, it is estimated that 1.8 billion people will live in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity, and 2/3 of the world’s population could be living under water-stressed conditions (2). Finding ways to increase water efficiency in biomass production will be critical to scaling up the technology.
3. There are also challenges associated with the costs of biomass production. Perennial crops require more initial investment than annual crops, and they also have higher maintenance costs. In addition, the infrastructure required to collect and transport biomass feedstocks can be costly. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, the levelized cost of energy from biomass is currently between $0.05 and $0.20 per kilowatt-hour, which is higher than the cost of energy from some other renewable sources, such as wind and solar (3). Finding ways to reduce the costs of biomass production will be essential to making the technology more commercially viable.
4. Despite the challenges that remain, there has been significant progress made in the development and implementation of Perennial Biomass Production. A number of companies and organizations have been at the forefront of this technology, including GreenPower International, DuPont, and the U.S. Department of Energy. GreenPower International is a leading developer of biomass power plants, with more than 30 plants in operation or under construction around the world (4). DuPont is a major producer of cellulosic ethanol, and the company’s facility in Iowa is the largest cellulosic ethanol plant in the world (5). The U.S. Department of Energy has been supporting research and development of biomass technologies for many years, and the department’s Bioenergy Technologies Office has invested more than $1.3 billion in biomass R&D since 2009 (6).
5. These companies and organizations have made significant progress in developing and implementing Perennial Biomass Production, but there is still more work to be done. Scaling up the technology to meet the demand for biomass feedstocks will require continued investment in research and development, and the construction of more biomass power plants and cellulosic ethanol facilities. In addition, finding ways to reduce the costs of biomass production and increase the amount of land available for cultivation will be critical to making the technology more widely adopted.

## Best Path Forward

The best path forward for the continued development and implementation of Perennial Biomass Production to effectively mitigate the effects of climate change is to continue research and development in order to improve the technology and make it more affordable. Additionally, government and private organizations should work together to promote the use of this technology and provide incentives for farmers to adopt it. Some companies and organizations that have been at the forefront of this solution include the Perennial Agriculture Consortium, the Soil Health Institute, and the Rodale Institute.
