I started The Climate Tech Handbook because I knew two things: I wanted to spend every second I could working on the climate emergencyI wanted to see if it's actually possible to make a decent living doing it What I found was astonishing. There number of resources out there are ASTRONOMICAL. Impossible for a single brain to handle. The other problem is that it's really hard to find an employer who is the perfect match. Even if you do, it's really hard to stand out from 500 other resumes without understanding the biggest challenges in their industry. So here we are, an early version 0.9 edition of The Climate Tech Handbook. My personal mission To give you a free shortcut and help you: Find the right solution to work onFind the right organization solving itMake sure you want to work thereLand the best job offerSucceed in your first 90 days The Handbook is completely open source and built by a community of like-minded job seekers.

The New York plan revised in 2011 placed even more emphasis on urban resilience to climate change, addressing the changes that have already occurred. In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy hit New York, resulting in 43 deaths and significant damage to the city, prompting the release of the New York Adaptation Plan in 2013.

There is a broad definition and a Silicon Valley-style industry definition.  Broad Definition\tIndustry DefinitionClimate Tech is any form of technology, physical or digital, that will help people implement climate change.\tClimate Tech is a recent financial movement to invest in startup companies that are focused on a solution to the climate emergency.  They are used interchangeably at times, but it is only a matter of one referring to a movement and the other being a physical thing that jump started the movement. The broad definition of climate tech is what we are mostly going to be using in this mini-course.  These climate technologies are focused on:  reducing GHG (Greenhouse gasses - gasses in the earth’s atmosphere that trap heat) emissions  The main sources of GHG emissions are divided into the following sectors, or subcategories, which we will go more in depth with later on in this course:  Electricity Food, Agriculture, and Land Use Industry Transportation Buildings  You have probably heard of clean tech before. What is it, and is it the same thing as climate tech?  What is clean tech?​  Clean TechThe term “clean tech”, short for clean technology, are technologies that reduce the environmental impact that existing technologies cause, as well as improve the quality of natural resources.  These clean tech technologies are focused on:  Reducing usage of “dirty” technologies (coal, gas, oil, mining, transportation, manufacturing).Improving areas of natural resources: clean water, air quality, recycling, clean energy  It is important to note that “clean tech” has a negative association with a failed “Clean Tech 1.0” startup period from 2006-2011. Learn more about this here:  How VCs can avoid another bloodbath as the clean-tech boom 2.0Eight lessons from the first climate boom and bust  Also, ever heard of “green tech”?​  Green tech is just an umbrella term for climate tech and clean tech. Climate tech and Clean tech are green tech. Climate tech and Clean tech are different are simply different from one another, however.

Click each drop-down menu below to read through each frequently asked question about climate jobs.​  How well does it pay? This depends on one thing: whether the job involves working with an early stage startup, an established company, or a government agency. Startups\tEstablished companies\tGovernment jobsTend to be paid lower salaries\tTend to be paid higher salaries\tLower salaries, but offer good health care and pensions More startups to choose from (Roughly 3,000+ companies and organizations to choose from our database!).\tYou can work for bigger companies once you rack up experience and/or have great networking skills!\tThere can be a higher level of job security, predictability, and transparency compared to a fast moving startup environment.  How can I use my voice as an employee? You can change the direction of the current company you work for to one that is involved in solving the climate crisis. Project Drawdown is a framework and guide you can use to not only educate yourself on ways you can help the climate through your actions at work, but how to leverage your climate actions to involve your colleagues and employer. Climate Voice hooks you up with tools to educate yourself on how to unlock corporate influence for climate, host events for Climate Voice to speak at your company or university, and an employee guide on how to advocate for the climate at your workplace. Work for Climate is another resource that offers courses where you can learn climate literacy skills, join webinars and expert talks on the inclusion of climate at work, as well as access to playbooks on topics such as Energy and Emissions.  How do I learn the necessary skills? You can get a climate job based on: Marketable skillsDomain knowledge Marketable skills\tDomain KnowledgeMarketable skills are skills that you bring from other jobs, such as data analysis, digital marketing, project management, UX, and more, hat can be applicable and relevant to climate jobs.\tDomain knowledge is the knowledge you have relating to the specific industry of climate tech. If you already have marketable skills and 3+ years of tech experience, there are plenty of jobs that have the same roles as a non-climate tech company.\tIf you need to gain domain knowledge on climate tech: we built the Handbook to gather the best information on all 93 Climate Solutions from Project Drawdown. Need to gain experience and domain knowledge? Writing is learning. Kill two birds with one stone by contributing to The Climate Tech Handbook.  How secure are these jobs? It varies by job category and climate solution. Depending on the job category--whether it is a startup, established company, or a government job, security varies. Here is a Fact Sheet that details the demand for climate jobs, and which sectors have been steadily on the rise in the United States. Depending on the climate solution--whether it is a more established solution or an early one, job security varies. For instance, the highest anticipated growth are in automotive, power generation, and electrical efficiency. Voluntary Carbon Markets started as a popular solution, but have recently been hit by a round of layoffs, due to public criticism on overstated benefits. As we continue writing the Handbook together, we will better be tracking news on Solution viability in the marketplace.  How much do I need to know about climate science and politics? This depends on two things: The solution space and the job role 1. The Solution space​ For example, a solution involving the electrical grid can get quite complicated. In this case, you would need to already know or learn a lot about the science and politics that falls under this solution. 2. The job role​ Some jobs and associated skills are more transferable than others.For instance, if you are a software engineer or running people operations, the skills you developed in these roles are highly transferable in climate tech. However, if you work in sales or marketing, there is a larger learning curve, and you will need to learn the particular skills of the industry market you are looking to work in for climate tech.  How do I avoid greenwashing? Greenwashing occurs when a company or product is presented as being more environmentally friendly than they actually are. Some examples of this can include &quot;embellishing claims about product ingredients, recycling efforts, carbon emissions reductions, or overall commitment to sustainability.&quot; Tech Target provides a guide on how to avoid greenwashing. CNN Underscored also dissects ways to avoid greenwashing, as well as how to identify it in the first place.

This would allow us to avoid the most catastrophic impacts.  To do so, we need to cut greenhouse pollution down 50% by 2030 and 100% by 2050.  By 2050 we need to be at &quot;net zero&quot;.  1.5 degrees versus 2 degrees celsius:​  Reaching our 2030 goal is not likely.  However, we still have a chance of keeping the global average temperature near 2 degrees celsius within the next 23 years.    Our carbon budget:​  There are many different calculations.    One budget from the Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change states:  The world is emitting roughly 42.2 gigatons of greenhouse pollution per year. We have roughly 995 gigatons left if we want some likelihood of staying below 2C. We have 250 gigatons of CO2 left to stay below 1.5 degrees, roughly 5 years.  The global standard comes from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).  Common myths:​  SkepticalScience.com maintains a good list counter-arguments to over 200 climate myths.  One of the most important myths to debunk is the belief that global temperatures will decline as greenhouse emissions go down.  This implies that we can partially reduce emissions and keep global temperatures at a stable level.

There are only a handful of charging stations in most cities and towns, and the majority of them are in private homes or businesses. This lack of infrastructure makes it difficult for people to switch to electric cars, as they would need to either install a charging station at their home or have access to one when they are out and about. Another challenge is the cost of electric cars. They are still significantly more expensive than traditional petrol or diesel cars, which makes them unaffordable for many people. The final challenge is the range of electric cars. The majority of electric cars can only travel for a few hundred miles before needing to be recharged, which is not suitable for long journeys.  Despite these challenges, there have been some successes in the development and implementation of electric cars. The most significant success is the decrease in emissions from electric cars. Electric cars produce zero emissions, which helps to reduce air pollution and combat climate change. Another success is the increase in efficiency of electric cars. Electric cars are much more efficient than traditional petrol or diesel cars, and this means that they use less energy and generate less pollution. Finally, the number of electric cars on the road is increasing. In 2015, there were around 1.2 million electric cars in the world, and this is expected to increase to 2 million by 2020.

Reducing emissions from the transportation, industry, and agricultural sectors is essential to prevent the worst effects of climate change. One way to do this is to promote family planning and education.  According to the Population Reference Bureau, “Family planning is critical to slowing and eventually reversing population growth.” When people have fewer children, they emit fewer greenhouse gases. In addition, when women have access to contraception, they can space their pregnancies further apart, which has health benefits for both the mother and the child.  There are many organizations working to promote family planning and education around the world. One example is the International Planned Parenthood Federation, which provides contraception and sexual education to millions of people every year.  There has been some progress in this area. For example, the global fertility rate has declined from 5.0 births per woman in 1950 to 2.5 births per woman in 2017. However, the world’s population is still growing, and much more needs to be done to reduce emissions.  To effectively mitigate the effects of climate change, it is essential to promote family planning and education on a large scale.

","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Lessons Learned​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Perennial Biomass Production","url":"/solution-perennial-biomass-production#lessons-learned","content":" Perennial biomass production is a promising technology for reversing climate change, but there are still many challenges associated with its development and implementation. One of the key lessons learned is that it is important to choose the right location for perennial biomass production. The climate and soil conditions in the chosen location must be suitable for the growth of the desired plants. Another lesson learned is that perennial biomass production requires a significant amount of land and water. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the environmental impact of this technology before implementing it on a large scale.  One of the challenges associated with perennial biomass production is that it is difficult to find suitable locations for cultivation. The climate and soil conditions in many parts of the world are not conducive to the growth of the desired plants. In addition, perennial biomass production requires a large amount of land and water. This can lead to environmental problems such as deforestation and water shortages.  Despite these challenges, there have been some successes associated with the development and implementation of perennial biomass production. For example, in the United States, the Department of Energy has been working on a project to develop perennial grasses that can be used for biofuel production. The goal of the project is to create a sustainable, renewable source of energy that does not compete with food production. In addition, a number of companies and organizations have been working on developing alternative sources of energy that do not rely on fossil fuels. These efforts suggest that it is possible to develop and implement perennial biomass production on a large scale.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Challenges Ahead​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Perennial Biomass Production","url":"/solution-perennial-biomass-production#challenges-ahead","content":" One of the main challenges that remain in the development and implementation of Perennial Biomass Production is the lack of available land to scale up the technology. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the total global land area suitable for cultivation is 12 billion hectares, but only 4 billion hectares are currently being used for crops and pasture (1). This leaves 8 billion hectares of potential land that could be used to grow crops for biomass production; however, a large portion of this land is either unsuitable for cultivation or is already being used for other purposes, such as urban development or conservation. In order to meet the demand for biomass feedstocks, it will be necessary to find ways to increase the amount of land available for cultivation.Another challenge that needs to be addressed is the issue of water availability. Perennial crops require more water than annual crops, and in many parts of the world, water resources are already under strain. According to the World Water Council, by 2025, it is estimated that 1.8 billion people will live in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity, and 2/3 of the world’s population could be living under water-stressed conditions (2). Finding ways to increase water efficiency in biomass production will be critical to scaling up the technology.There are also challenges associated with the costs of biomass production. Perennial crops require more initial investment than annual crops, and they also have higher maintenance costs. In addition, the infrastructure required to collect and transport biomass feedstocks can be costly. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, the levelized cost of energy from biomass is currently between $0.05 and $0.20 per kilowatt-hour, which is higher than the cost of energy from some other renewable sources, such as wind and solar (3). Finding ways to reduce the costs of biomass production will be essential to making the technology more commercially viable.Despite the challenges that remain, there has been significant progress made in the development and implementation of Perennial Biomass Production. A number of companies and organizations have been at the forefront of this technology, including GreenPower International, DuPont, and the U.S. Department of Energy. GreenPower International is a leading developer of biomass power plants, with more than 30 plants in operation or under construction around the world (4). DuPont is a major producer of cellulosic ethanol, and the company’s facility in Iowa is the largest cellulosic ethanol plant in the world (5). The U.S. Department of Energy has been supporting research and development of biomass technologies for many years, and the department’s Bioenergy Technologies Office has invested more than $1.3 billion in biomass R&amp;D since 2009 (6).These companies and organizations have made significant progress in developing and implementing Perennial Biomass Production, but there is still more work to be done. Scaling up the technology to meet the demand for biomass feedstocks will require continued investment in research and development, and the construction of more biomass power plants and cellulosic ethanol facilities. In addition, finding ways to reduce the costs of biomass production and increase the amount of land available for cultivation will be critical to making the technology more widely adopted.

It can cost up to ten times more to recycle a plastic bottle than it does to simply throw it away. And, even when recycling is possible, it often results in a lower-quality product. This is because recycling often relies on manual labor, which is expensive, and because recycled materials are often contaminated with other waste.  One way to overcome these challenges is to develop new technologies that make recycling easier and more cost-effective. For example, companies like Recyclable Solutions are developing automated recycling machines that can sort and recycle various materials quickly and efficiently.  Another way to scale up recycling is to create incentives for people to recycle. For example, some cities offer financial rewards for recycling certain materials. Others have implemented laws that require people to recycle certain materials.

This means reducing consumption, reusing products, and recycling. Recycling is a process of turning waste into new products. It diverts waste from landfills and incinerators, and reduces greenhouse gas emissions.  To ensure that recycling is adopted on a large scale and is effective, the following steps need to be taken:  Implement policies to increase recycling rates.  Policies that increase recycling rates can include mandatory recycling, pay-as-you-throw programs, and bottle bills.  Increase public education and awareness about the benefits of recycling.  Recycling programs will only be successful if people know about them and understand how to participate. Public education and awareness campaigns can help increase recycling rates.  Make recycling easy and convenient.  People are more likely to recycle if it is easy and convenient to do so. Recycling programs should be designed with this in mind.  Invest in infrastructure.  To be successful, recycling programs need the right infrastructure in place. This includes things like collection facilities, sorting facilities, and markets for recycled materials.

The trees can be used for shade, windbreaks, or to provide food for livestock. The forage can be used to graze livestock or to provide feed for other animals.  The benefits of Silvopasture include improved soil health, increased water infiltration, increased carbon sequestration, and improved air quality. Silvopasture can also improve the efficiency of livestock production by providing shade and windbreaks for animals, and by providing a source of food.  Silvopasture systems have been used for centuries, but the modern practice of Silvopasture is a relatively new development. The first Silvopasture system in the United States was established in the early 1990s. Since then, Silvopasture has been adopted by farmers and ranchers across the country.  There are a number of companies and organizations that are working to promote Silvopasture as a solution to climate change. The American Carbon Registry (ACR) is a non-profit organization that works with farmers and ranchers to offset their carbon emissions. The ACR has developed a Silvopasture carbon offset protocol that can be used by farmers to offset their emissions.  The National Silvopasture Cooperative is a network of farmers, ranchers, foresters, and other land managers who are working to promote Silvopasture. The cooperative provides information and resources to help land managers implement Silvopasture systems on their land.  The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has also been working to promote Silvopasture. The USDA has developed a Silvopasture planning guide that can be used by farmers and ranchers to develop Silvopasture systems on their land.  The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is a federal agency that provides technical and financial assistance to farmers and ranchers. The NRCS has developed a Silvopasture Conservation Practice Standard that can be used by farmers and ranchers to implement Silvopasture systems on their land.  Silvopasture is a promising solution to climate change, but there are still some challenges that need to be addressed. One of the biggest challenges is finding the right mix of trees and forage that will best meet the needs of the land manager and the livestock. Another challenge is finding the right management practices that will allow the trees and forage to thrive while also providing the desired benefits.

What are the challenges for demand response  PDF: This creates a need for demand response programs,  However, there are several challenges associated with implementing effective demand response programs. One challenge is that many consumers are not aware of the programs or do not understand how they work. Additionally, some consumers may be hesitant to participate in demand response programs due to concerns about comfort or convenience.  Another challenge is that demand response programs must be carefully designed to avoid unintended consequences. For example, if a demand response program incentivizes consumers to shift their electricity usage to off-peak hours, this could lead to increased demand during those hours and actually exacerbate the problem of peak demand.  Finally, demand response programs must be integrated into the larger electricity market in order to be effective. This requires coordination between utilities, grid operators, and other stakeholders to ensure that demand response resources are available when needed and that they are compensated fairly for their participation.  Me: what are some of the success stories with demand response so far? Which companies are succeed and which have failed?  PDF: There have been several successful demand response programs implemented in various regions around the world. One notable example is the PJM Interconnection, which operates the largest wholesale electricity market in the United States. PJM has implemented a successful demand response program that has helped to reduce peak demand and improve grid reliability.  Another successful demand response program is the OpenADR program, which is a standard for automated demand response that allows utilities and grid operators to communicate with customers and control their energy usage in real-time. The OpenADR program has been implemented in several countries, including the United States, Japan, and Australia.  In terms of companies that have succeeded or failed in implementing demand response programs, it is difficult to make generalizations as the success of a program depends on many factors, including the specific market conditions and regulatory environment. However, some companies that have been successful in implementing demand response programs include EnerNOC, which provides demand response services to commercial and industrial customers, and Nest, which offers a smart thermostat that can automatically adjust a home's temperature to reduce energy usage during peak demand periods.  On the other hand, there have been some high-profile failures in the demand response space, such as the bankruptcy of EnergyConnect, a demand response provider that filed for bankruptcy in 2011. However, it is important to note that the reasons for these failures are often complex and may not be directly related to the demand response programs themselves.
