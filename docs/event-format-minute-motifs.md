### What are Minute Motifs??

They are very similar to [Lightning Talks](event-format-lightning-talks) but:

1. **ONE MINUTE** to talk, with only one **ONE SLIDE** (instead of 5 minutes)

2. **Many more presenters**, due to the very short 1 minute presentation time

3. **Designed for networking**, because so many cool ideas are shared

## Primary goal - enlightenment and inspiration

- Promote local thought leaders

- Get people thinking in new ways

- Break the ice with new ideas


## There are 5 steps

:::note The 5 Steps
1. Pick a Venue

2. Organize presenters

3. Promote the event

4. Put on a great show

5. Share the Results
:::

## STEP ONE: Pick a Venue

The details are more important than other [event formats](event-guide), because Lightning Talks require both a visual display for slides and audio amplification to hear your presenting speakers.

We'll cover this below after you've also considered
- **Size** (not to small)

- **Location** (easy to get to)

- **Amenities** (food and drinks on site, seating, not too noisy)

:::tip
As your list of venues grow, **Share It** for future reference with other organizers.
:::


### Special Considerations

- Audio amplification

- Visual display for slides (large video monitor(s) or projection screen)

- Seating for the audience


If the venue requires a minimum fee, you may want to charge for tickets and/or find a sponsor.

### How to find a sponsor

- Make a list of climate tech companies in your area. Go to [climatetechlist.com](https://climatetechlist.com) or [climatebase.org](https://climatebase.org) and filter by location.

- Find connections on LinkedIn, ask for intros to get in the door. You can try messaging someone who works there on the [Work on Climate Slack Community](https://workonclimate.org).

- Make your pitch in the company's interest by giving thanking them and allowing them to announce something before the panel starts.
If a venue requires a reservation fee, you may have luck requesting a waiver in support of the climate change community.

:::info Nuture your sponsors
It's great to have a reliable sponsor for future events.

If you nurture the relationship, other community organizers who need sponsors can benefit.

This is a fantastic way to grow your local ecosystem

## STEP TWO: Organize presenters

This involves:

1. Putting out a Call for Speakers

2. Categorizing your speakers based on a set of criteria

3. Communicating the results to those selected and not selected

4. Coaching your speakers and sharing logistics

### Putting out a Call for Speakers

The easiest way to do this is to create a short form ([like this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScZ6ooCPQWQqb5ibGiUptHP4J39sxv9S0zJXZrJzlSy9f3NUQ/viewform)).

The form will have a short intro on the event, explain what you're looking for in a speaker, and a few questions about the speaker's pitch and background.

### Scoring Speakers

First - you'll need to have a set of scoring criteria to rank your proposals.

For example:

- Important themes and categories

- Diversity of ideas

- Diversity of backgrounds


You also want to consider the speaking order and the "flow" of the event to set the right mood throughout.

For example:

- A playful opener

- A hot button issue before intermission

- A funny quirky topic

- A closer that's inspiring and memorable


When you have that established, you can score your proposals on a spreadsheet.


### Communicating back


### Coaching your speakers and sharing logistics

- Tech rehearsal

- Dry run




## STEP THREE: Promote the event
Use a tool such as [Luma](https://lu.ma) to craft a sharable event. Ensure the climate theme and any other goals or activities are clear.

Utilize various marketing channels such as social media platforms, email newsletters, and your personal network to spread the word. Encourage others to share the event.

In Seattle - we use the [Work on Climate Slack](workonclimate.org) and post in the #meet-seattle channel  
:::

## STEP FOUR: Put on a great show

1. Beforehand, gather any required materials. Common materials are markers and name tags.

2. Arrive early on the event day to set up, address any last-minute concerns, and be ready to welcome attendees with organization and enthusiasm.

:::info Remember
Take tons of photos:

- All speakers individually on stage

- Your audience enjoying themselves

- A group photo with presenters and organizers together
:::

## STEP FIVE: Share the Results!
After the event, utilize social media to share the highlights with those who attended and those who missed out. Sharing the results not only celebrates the success of the event but also encourages future engagement and participation.
