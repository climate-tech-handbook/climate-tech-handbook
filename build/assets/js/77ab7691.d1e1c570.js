One of the successes associated with public transit is that it has helped to reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. For instance, in 2016, public transit saved 37 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions in the United States alone. This is equivalent to taking 7.9 million cars off the road. Moreover, public transit can also help to reduce congestion, which can lead to less pollution and fewer emissions. In addition, public transit can also help to reduce traffic fatalities. In the United States, for example, traffic fatalities have decreased by 50 percent since 1970, thanks in part to the development and implementation of public transit."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"There have also been some failures associated with public transit. One of the main problems is that public transit can be expensive to build and maintain. For instance, the Second Avenue Subway in New York City is expected to cost $4.5 billion.

This can be frustrating for riders and can lead to fewer people using public transit."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Despite the successes and failures of public transit, it is still an important solution for reversing climate change. One of the key lessons that we can learn from the development and implementation of public transit is that it is important to invest in public transit infrastructure.
