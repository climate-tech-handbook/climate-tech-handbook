## Overview

Nuclear power is a clean and efficient way to generate electricity. It produces no greenhouse gas emissions and can help reverse climate change. There have been significant advances in nuclear power technology in recent years, including the development of small modular reactors (SMRs). These reactors are less expensive to build and operate than traditional nuclear reactors, and they can be deployed in a variety of locations. SMRs also have a much smaller environmental footprint than traditional reactors.

Nuclear power plants currently operating in the United States have prevented the release of more than 2.5 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. That’s equivalent to the annual emissions of more than 500 million cars.

There are more than 450 nuclear reactors operating in 30 countries around the world. These reactors provide about 10% of the world’s electricity.

There are several companies and organizations at the forefront of nuclear power development, including the U.S. Department of Energy, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the World Nuclear Association.

## Progress Made

Progress on developing nuclear power to reverse climate change has been made through the development of new nuclear technologies that are cleaner and more efficient. These include small modular reactors, which are easier and cheaper to build than traditional nuclear reactors, and thorium-based reactors, which are more efficient and produce less radioactive waste. These technologies have contributed to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by providing a cleaner and more efficient source of energy.

Some of the companies and organizations that have been at the forefront of developing nuclear power to reverse climate change include the World Nuclear Association, the Nuclear Energy Agency, and the International Atomic Energy Agency.

## Lessons Learned

1. Successes: 
   -Nuclear power plants emit no greenhouse gases during operation. In fact, the average nuclear power plant prevents the release of more than 2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide each year – which is equivalent to taking 400,000 cars off the road. 
   -Nuclear power is carbon-free, and it produces more electricity than any other source of emission-free energy. 
   -Nuclear energy provides about 11 percent of the world’s electricity today, and it prevents the release of more than 700 million metric tons of carbon dioxide each year. 
   -If we want to meet our climate goals and prevent the most catastrophic effects of climate change, we need to rapidly expand nuclear power.
2. Failures: 
   -The high cost of building nuclear power plants has been a major barrier to their expansion. 
   -Nuclear power plants are also very expensive to maintain and decommission. 
   -Nuclear accidents, like the one that occurred at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant in Japan in 2011, can cause widespread environmental damage and contamination. 
   -Nuclear waste is also a major problem. It is extremely radioactive and can stay dangerous for thousands of years. There is currently no safe way to store it long-term.
3. Lessons Learned: 
   -Nuclear power is a low-carbon energy source that can help us meet our climate goals. 
   -Nuclear power plants are expensive to build and maintain, and nuclear accidents can cause environmental damage. 
   -Nuclear waste is a major problem that needs to be addressed.

## Challenges Ahead

The challenges that remain in the development and implementation of Nuclear Power to reverse climate change are as follows:

1. Cost: Nuclear power is still relatively expensive when compared to other forms of energy such as natural gas, coal, and renewables.
2. Safety: There is always the potential for accidents and nuclear meltdowns, which could have devastating consequences.
3. Waste: Nuclear waste is highly radioactive and must be carefully managed and disposed of.
4. Proliferation: Nuclear technology can be used for both peaceful and military purposes. There is a risk that nuclear weapons could spread if more countries develop nuclear power.

Despite these challenges, nuclear power remains a promising solution for climate change. Nuclear power is carbon-free and could provide a significant amount of energy without contributing to climate change. If nuclear power is to be widely adopted, the cost must come down and the safety concerns must be addressed.

## Best Path Forward

The best path forward for the continued development and implementation of nuclear power to effectively mitigate the effects of climate change is to continue to invest in research and development to make the technology more efficient and safe. Additionally, steps need to be taken to ensure that the infrastructure is in place to support a large-scale rollout of nuclear power plants. This includes training operators, developing a regulatory framework, and building public support.

Some of the companies and organizations that have been at the forefront of nuclear power development include the U.S. Department of Energy, the Electric Power Research Institute, and NuScale Power.
