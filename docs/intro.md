- **People are suffering** - [5 million deaths per year](https://www.sciencealert.com/abnormal-temperatures-could-already-account-for-5-million-deaths-a-year) and [billions of economic damage](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/beyond-data/2021-us-billion-dollar-weather-and-climate-disasters-historical) already.
