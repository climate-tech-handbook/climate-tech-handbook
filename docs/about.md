# About Us

![Cover Image](../static/img/offshore-wind-farm.jpg)

The climate tech movement is **exploding**.

Every day there is news about which technologies are succeeding, which are failing, and the best ways to make an impact.


## Our Mission

To build the world's most **accessible**, yet **comprehensive**, resource for anyone using technology to address our climate emergency.


## Our Vision

The Climate Tech Handbook is here to serve:

1. [Job seekers](../career-guide) in Climate Tech

2. Startup funders, founders, and leaders


We value:

1) **Quality** [journalism](/contribute/#quality-journalism)

2) **Measurable** [impact](/contribute/#measurable-impact)

3) **Strong** [community](/contribute/#strong-community)



## Team

The Handbook was started by [Jacob Caggiano](https://jacobcaggiano.com).

We are made possible by our [Advisory Board](#advisory-board) and an active community of [Contributors](../contribute)
