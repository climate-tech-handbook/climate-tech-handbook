_In Level 1_, you will read up on climate definitions, and it is _recommended_ that you read some of the articles that are linked in this level for a comprehensive background.

## What is Climate Tech?

The term "climate tech", short for climate technology, is **used in two related ways.** There is a _broad_ definition and a _Silicon Valley-style industry_ definition.

| Broad Definition   | Industry Definition |
|    --------        |      -------        |
|Climate Tech is **any form of technology, physical or digital**, that will help people implement climate change.|Climate Tech is a **recent financial movement to invest in startup companies** that are focused on a solution to the climate emergency.

**They are used interchangeably at times**, but it is only a matter of one referring to a movement and the other being a physical thing that jump started the movement. The broad definition of climate tech is what we are mostly going to be using in this mini-course.

**These climate technologies are focused on:**
- _reducing GHG_ (Greenhouse gasses - gasses in the earth‚Äôs atmosphere that trap heat) _emissions_



**The main sources of GHG emissions are divided into the following sectors, or subcategories**, which we will go more in depth with later on in this course:

1. Electricity

2. Food, Agriculture, and Land Use

3. Industry

4. Transportation

5. Buildings


You have probably heard of clean tech before. What is it, and is it the same thing as _climate tech_?


### What is clean tech?

| Clean Tech    |
| -------- |
|The term ‚Äúclean tech‚Äù, short for clean technology, are **technologies that reduce the environmental impact that existing technologies cause**, as well as **improve the quality of natural resources**. |


**These clean tech technologies are focused on**:

- **Reducing usage of ‚Äúdirty‚Äù technologies** (coal, gas, oil, mining, transportation, manufacturing).
- **Improving areas of natural resources**: clean water, air quality, recycling, clean energy

It is important to note that ‚Äúclean tech‚Äù has a negative association with a failed ‚ÄúClean Tech 1.0‚Äù startup period from 2006-2011. **Learn more about this here:**
- [How VCs can avoid another bloodbath as the clean-tech boom 2.0](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/11/30/1012660/venture-capital-clean-tech-boom-biden/)
- [Eight lessons from the first climate boom and bust](https://www.bvp.com/atlas/eight-lessons-from-the-first-climate-tech-boom-and-bust)

#### _Also, ever heard of ‚Äúgreen tech‚Äù?_

Green tech is just **an umbrella term for climate tech and clean tech**. Climate tech and Clean tech _are_ green tech. Climate tech and Clean tech are different are simply different from one another, however.

<!--questions about IT tech, deep tech, hard tech, and trade work-->

:::
### How well does it pay?

#### Early stage startups:

You will be dealing with a lot of early stage startups.

Roughly 3,000+ companies / organizations exist in our current database.

Most often:
- **Early stage startups tend to pay lower salaries** in exchange for generous equity packages.

- **That said, climate startups want to attract quality talent** and hopefully understand that competitive pay is important.

#### Established companies:

:::note another option
Change the direction of your current company.

Or try to steer a bigger company that's been around for a while.

- Project Drawdown has a [guide on this topic](https://drawdown.org/sites/default/files/210920_Drawdown_AtWork_06.pdf). Organizations like [Climate Voice](https://climatevoice.org/) and [Work for Climate](http://workforclimate.org) specialize in this.
<!-- Check for PDF updates periodically -->
- Companies like Microsoft, Google, Stripe, etc. have a specific corporate 
sustainability positions. There are also many consultancies you can join.

- Think outside the box. For example, you are in procurement, you have a 
huge opportunity to order supplies that come from clean sources. Start a green team that doesn't exist in your current job
:::

#### Don't forget Government Jobs:

:::note Government Jobs
There are plenty of government jobs <!--governmentjobs.com example urls-->

- The salaries are lower, but some states and counties <!--munis??--> offer good health care and pensions

- There can be a higher level of job security, predictability, and transparency compared to a fast moving startup environment.

- Policy and academic roles are valuable as well (for example, analyzing the impact of voluntary carbon markets)

:::question
##  How do I learn the necessary skills?
:::

There are two aspects:

1. **Marketable skills**

2. **Domain knowledge**

Marketable Skills:

:::note 3+ years of tech experience
#### If you already have marketable skills and tech experience

There are [plenty of jobs](https://climatetechlist.com) that have the same roles as a non-climate tech company

:::

What if you don't have tech experience?

:::info Experience gap
#### If you are new to tech without 3+ years of experience

[You can contribute](contribute) to the Handbook as an open source project to gain experience quickly
:::

Next is domain knowledge.

:::tip Domain knowledge
#### You're in the right place!

- We built the Handbook to gather the best information on [all 93 Climate Solutions](solutions) from Project Drawdown

- Writing is learning. [Contribute to the Handbook](contribute) and become an expert
:::

:::question
###  How secure are these jobs?
:::

- **It varies by job category** - [Startup](early-stage-startups) vs [Established company](#established-companies) vs [Government](#dont-forget-government-jobs)

- **It varies by climate solution** - some solutions are better established and others are very early.

**For example:**

- The highest anticipated growth is in automotive, power generation, and electrical efficiency.  <!--citation. MCJ Podcast??, add links to solution pages-->

- Voluntary Carbon Markets started as a popular solution, but have recently been hit by a round of layoffs, due to public criticism on overstated benefits.

As we [continue writing the Handbook together](contribute), we will better be tracking news on [Solution](solutions) viability in the marketplace.

---

:::question
### How much do I need to know about climate science and politics?
:::

It depends on:

#### 1. The [Solution](solution) space

For example, a solution involving the [electrical](sector-electricity) grid can get quite complicated.


#### 2. The job role


- When it comes to the role, being a software engineer or running people operations are more transferrable. 

- But, you are in sales or marketing, you need to know as much as possible about your industry market.

---

:::question
###  How do I avoid greenwashing?
:::

- Read and support journalism outlets such as [DeSmog](https://www.desmog.com//), [Grist](grist.org), [Inside Climate News](https://insideclimatenews.org/), [Climate Desk](climatedesk.org), [Drilled](https://drilled.media), and more.
<!--Link to Resources, and Media Sector-->
- This is a big topic and we are working on a guide

- [Tell us your findings on Slack](contribute) and we'll report on it

## Fundamental Climate Knowledge

:::info If you already know this
Skip to:
- [Solution Frameworks](#solution-frameworks)

- [Core Communities](#core-communities)

- [Skill Requirements](#skill-requirements)
:::
###

#### The 2015 Paris Agreement:

The bottom line is that we are supposed to keep the global average temperature down to **1.5 degrees celsius**.

This would allow us to avoid [the most catastrophic impacts](https://www.npr.org/2021/11/08/1052198840/1-5-degrees-warming-climate-change).

To do so, **we need to cut greenhouse pollution down 50% by 2030 and 100% by 2050.**

By 2050 we need to be at "net zero".

#### 1.5 degrees versus 2 degrees celsius:

Reaching our 2030 goal is not likely.

However, we still have a chance of keeping the global average temperature near 2 degrees celsius within the next 23 years.

></iframe>

#### Our carbon budget:

There are many different calculations.

![carbon budget hourglass](../static/img/carbon-budget.jpg)

One [budget from the Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change](https://www.mcc-berlin.net/en/research/co2-budget.html) states:

- The world is emitting roughly 42.2 gigatons of greenhouse pollution per year.

- **We have roughly 995 gigatons left if we want some likelihood of staying below 2C.**

- We have [250 gigatons of CO2 left](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/06/08/carbon-budget-study-climate-change/) to stay below 1.5 degrees, roughly 5 years.

The global standard comes from the United Nations [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change](https://www.ipcc.ch) (IPCC).


#### Common myths:

[SkepticalScience.com maintains a good list](https://skepticalscience.com/argument.php) counter-arguments to over 200 climate myths.

One of the [most important myths to debunk](https://upgrader.gapminder.org/q/85) is the belief that global temperatures will decline as greenhouse emissions go down.

This implies that we can partially reduce emissions and keep global temperatures at a stable level.

In reality, carbon dioxide persists for [hundreds of years](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases#CO2-references)

**We need to cut emissions completely** to stop any further damage.

Partial cuts will not work.

## Solution Frameworks

Time for the good news. We have solutions!

![forest and river](../static/img/climate-solutions.png)

### Project Drawdown

<img src={ddlogo} width="500"/>

[Project Drawdown](https://drawdown.org) is a non-profit organization that created a list of the 93 top climate solutions.

The list comes from a global coalition of leading scientists.

They calculated and ranked the highest likelihood of reducing greenhouse pollution based on available solutions today.

Examples include:

- Reducing food waste

- Alternatives to meat

- Alternative refrigerants

- Family planning

:::note
The Handbook's [Solution Page](solutions) is mostly based off of Project Drawdown.
:::

### Speed and Scale

<img src={sslogo} width="300"/>

[Created by venture capitalist John Doerr](https://speedandscale.com), this framework has both similarities and differences with Drawdown.

Rather than a big list of 93 Solutions ranked by gigaton reduction, the Speed and Scale framework uses Doerr's popular [OKR system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectives_and_key_results) for measuring "objective key results."

:::note OKR Tracker
Here is Speed and Scale's [official OKR Tracker](https://speedandscale.com/tracker/)
:::

:::question
#### Which framework to use?
:::

Both are valuable and are not mutually exlusive.

Project Drawdown has some more granular solutions, while Speed and Scale has larger categories.

Speed and Scale has a great OKR system that is time bound and uses very specific metrics to track progress.

## Core Communities

There are [26 Slack communities listed here](https://www.climatefinance.xyz/climate-slack-communities).

Some are generalized for climate job seekers, and others are specialized toward roles (climate designers) and solutions.

**Here are 3 to start with:**

---

### The Climate Tech Handbook

<img src={cthlogo} width="300"/>

Our community is designed for people who want to level up their portfolio.

We're building the handbook together to show off our skills and knowledge.

<a href="https://chat.climatetechhandbook.com" class="doc-button">Join our Slack</a>

<br/>

### Work on Climate

https://workonclimate.org

![Work on Climate logo](/img/woc-logo.jpg)

The largest Slack community for climate work.

25,000+ members


### MCJ Collective

https://mcjcollective.com

![MCJ Collective logo](/img/mcjcollective-logo.png)

This one costs $10 per month, but is well worth it.

Work on Climate is very heavy toward job seekers, while MCJ also has a strong startup / investor community.

The MCJ Collective are investors themselves.

MCJ stands for My Climate Journey
