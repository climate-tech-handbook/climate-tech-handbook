*Benefits of tree-based restoration ([Nature](https://www.nature.org/content/dam/tnc/nature/en/documents/Business_of_Planting_Trees_Report.pdf))*

## Overview

There has been significant progress made in developing tree plantations (on degraded land) to reverse climate change. Breakthrough technologies such as satellite mapping and drone mapping have been developed and have contributed to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Companies and organizations such as GreenTrees, TerraReforestation, and Reforestum have been at the forefront of this solution.

## Progress Made

In recent years, there has been increasing interest in using tree plantations to reverse climate change. This is because tree plantations can help to sequester carbon dioxide, which is a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. There are several breakthrough technologies that have been developed in recent years that have helped to make tree plantations more effective at sequestering carbon dioxide.

One example of a breakthrough technology is the use of GIS mapping to help identify areas that are suitable for tree plantations. This technology can help to identify areas that have the potential to sequester the most carbon dioxide.

Another example of a breakthrough technology is the use of drones to help plant trees. This technology can help to reduce the cost of planting trees and to increase the efficiency of tree planting.

Several companies and organizations have been at the forefront of developing tree plantations to reverse climate change. One example is the Carbon Neutral Company, which is a UK-based company that helps businesses to offset their carbon emissions. Another example is the World Resources Institute, which is a think tank that has been working on developing tree plantations as a solution to climate change.

## Lessons Learned

Some key lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of tree plantations (on degraded land) to reverse climate change are as follows: 

\-It is important to ensure that the trees planted are of a species that is native to the area. This will help to ensure that the trees are able to thrive in the local environment and will not require a lot of additional resources (such as water) to survive.

\-It is also important to ensure that the trees are planted in an area that has been properly prepared. This means clearing the area of any debris and other obstacles that could impede the growth of the trees.

\-It is crucial to monitor the progress of the trees after they have been planted. This will help to ensure that they are growing properly and are not being affected by any pests or diseases.

Some companies and organizations that have been at the forefront of this solution include the World Agroforestry Centre and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

## Challenges Ahead

One major challenge that remains in the development and implementation of tree plantations is that it is difficult to find degraded land that is not already being used for other purposes, such as agriculture or housing. Another challenge is that tree plantations require a lot of water and nutrients, which can be expensive and difficult to obtain in some areas. Finally, tree plantations can take many years to mature and begin to sequester carbon, so they are not a quick fix for climate change.

Organizations such as the World Agroforestry Centre and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations have been working to promote tree plantations as a way to combat climate change. Some progress has been made in this area, but there is still a long way to go.

## Best Path Forward

There are a number of steps that need to be taken in order to ensure that tree plantations are effective in mitigating the effects of climate change. First, it is important to ensure that the tree species that are being planted are well-suited to the local climate and soil conditions. Second, the tree plantations should be designed and managed in a way that maximizes their carbon sequestration potential. Finally, it is important to ensure that the tree plantations are properly maintained and monitored over time to ensure that they remain effective.

Some companies and organizations that have been at the forefront of this solution include the World Wildlife Fund, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, and the World Bank.
