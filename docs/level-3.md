:::

## Climate Solution - Deep Dive

You've poked around the [Climate Sectors and Solutions](solutions).

Now it's time to pick just one 🫢

You don't have to stick with it forever.

Try one out for 2-4 weeks, then decide if you want to switch.

<br/>

:::tip Example
You're going to focus exclusively on seaweed farming. 

You can spend your research time exploring the [phyconomy](https://phyconomy.net/) database and newsletter. 

:::

Now it's time to hone in on just 10 companies.

## TOP 10 Company List

Start simple.

### STEP 1: Spreadsheet
Make a spreadsheet with columns:

- Company
- LinkedIn page URL
- Challenges
- Opportunities
- Network

### STEP 2: Company Data

<!--Zach's Notion template-->

Go to the [ClimateBase job board](https://climatebase.org/jobs).

[![ClimateBase Drawdown Filter](/img/climatebase-drawdown-filter.png)](https://climatebase.org/jobs)

Filter job openings by Drawdown Solution.

After you add 10 companies who are hiring, add 5 more companies who aren't hiring

These extra 5 are your dream job companies.

It's your long game strategy to network with those 5 companies so you can find a "hidden job" before it's publicly posted.

<!--You can also explore the Climate Tech List verticals.-->


### STEP 3: Behavior

:::note Remember

It is your behavior that influences your attitude, not the other way around.

Consistency is everything.

Focus on actions not outcomes.
:::

- Set a goal of 5 outreach messages on Slack and LinkedIn, plus 5 connection requests per day.

- Listen to one podcast episode per day on wireless headphones while doing dishes or cooking dinner.

- Read one email newsletter per day.

- Attend 1-3 webinars per week.
