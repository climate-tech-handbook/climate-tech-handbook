## Primary goal - have fun and learn

- People love trivia. There's extra spirit that comes with the team competition.

- By forming teams with people who don't know each other, a shared bond emerges when trying to solve questions together.


## There are 5 steps

:::note The 5 Steps

1. Find a partner

2. Pick a Venue

3. Prepare questions

4. Create a Sharable Event

5. Share the Event

6. Put on a show

7. Share the Results
:::

## 1. Find a partner

It's a lot easier with a partner. 

- You can help each other come up with questions

- One person does emcee duties

- The other person collects answers from the tables and tallies the score


## 2. Pick a Venue

Make a list of potential venues.

Consider
- **Size** (not to small)

- **Location** (easy to get to)

- **Amenities** (food and drinks on site, seating, not too noisy)

:::tip
As your list of venues grow, **Share It** for future reference with other organizers.
:::


### Special Considerations

- Prizes

- Audio amplification

- Food and drink service

- Seating for the audience


The best way to pay for prizes is to **find a sponsor**.

### How to find a sponsor

- Make a list of climate tech companies in your area. Go to [climatetechlist.com](https://climatetechlist.com) or [climatebase.org](https://climatebase.org) and filter by location.

- Find connections on LinkedIn, ask for intros to get in the door. You can try messaging someone who works there on the [Work on Climate Slack Community](https://workonclimate.org).

- Make your pitch in the company's interest by giving thanking them and allowing them to announce something before the panel starts.
If a venue requires a reservation fee, you may have luck requesting a waiver in support of the climate change community.

It's good to build a relationship with venues for future events.

### Audio amplification

Find a bar that has hosted previous events with audio. For example:

- A trivia night (call and ask if they are open to a climate theme)

- Karaoke

- Stand up comedy

## 2. Prepare in advance

### Coming up with questions

- **Balance difficulty** - not too easy and not too difficult

- **Topics**

- Use slides and multimedia

## 2. Create a Sharable Event
Use a tool such as [Luma](https://lu.ma) to craft a sharable event. Ensure the climate theme and any other goals or activities are clear.

## 3. Share the Event!
Utilize various marketing channels such as social media platforms, email newsletters, and your personal network to spread the word. Encourage others to share the event.

### Prize ideas

- Organic apple cider and chocolates
