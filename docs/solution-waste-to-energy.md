Waste-to-Energy (WtE) is a process that converts waste materials into usable forms of energy such as heat, fuels, or electricity. This technology plays a crucial role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from landfills while simultaneously generating renewable energy.

![Waste is mixed, combusted, and repeatedly turned for thorough burning. Fly ash and acidic gases are neutralized, metals extracted for recycling, and remaining ash used in construction. Steam powers a generator, with cooling steam reused or diverted for heating. Finally, activated carbon and ammonia injections remove heavy metals and neutralize nitrogen oxides, while high temperatures destroy dioxins and furans.](/../static/img/waste-to-energy.jpg)
