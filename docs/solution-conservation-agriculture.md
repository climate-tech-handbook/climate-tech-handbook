Conservation agriculture involves practices that reduce soil disturbance, maintain soil cover, and diversify crop rotations. These methods enhance soil health, increase yields, and store soil carbon, contributing to climate change mitigation.

## Progress Made

Notable advancements in conservation agriculture for climate change include:

1. **No-Till Farming**: Reducing soil disturbance to maintain soil structure and health.
2. **Cover Crops**: Planting crops to cover the soil, preventing erosion and improving soil fertility.
3. **Crop Rotation**: Alternating crops to improve soil health and reduce pest pressure.
