## Progress Made

Significant advancements have been made in small hydropower technologies:

1. **Micro-Hydro Turbines**: Development of efficient, small-scale turbines for local power generation.
2. **Run-of-River Systems**: Low-impact hydropower systems that don't require large reservoirs.
3. **Fish-Friendly Turbines**: Innovations to reduce impacts on aquatic ecosystems.

## Solutions by Sector

### Rural Electrification
- **Off-Grid Systems**: Providing electricity to remote communities.
- **Hybrid Systems**: Combining small hydropower with other renewables for reliable power.
- **Productive Use Applications**: Powering local industries and agriculture.

**Case Studies:**
