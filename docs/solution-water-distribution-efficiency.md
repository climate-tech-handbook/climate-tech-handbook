Water distribution efficiency involves using innovative methods to achieve the same goals with less water consumption. This technology encompasses strategies like drought-resistant plants, xeriscaping, rainwater harvesting, greywater recycling, and low-flow plumbing fixtures. Such approaches curtail the reliance on municipal water sources, subsequently reducing energy demands for pumping and treatment, thus contributing to climate change mitigation.
