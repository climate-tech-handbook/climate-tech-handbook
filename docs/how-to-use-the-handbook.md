## The Dream Job System

Our model is loosely based off of Austin Belcak's [Dream Job System](https://cultivatedculture.com/djs-podcast/).

:::note The Dream Climate Job System
1. **Find your [Climate Solution](solutions)**
2. **Pick 10 companies** - doing the best work on that solution
3. **Build your portfolio and network** - to prove that you are the best hire, regardless of formal experience
