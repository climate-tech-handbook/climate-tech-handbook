Refrigerants are a major contributor to greenhouse gases. This article outlines the changes companies are making to both move to greener alternatives to refrigerate our food, homes, and businesses. Honeywell International, Diakin Industries, and more are helping the world move to greener systems.

## Overview

As the earth warms, air conditioning is becoming more of a necessity to combat heat waves. But the refrigerants used in home, commercial, industrial, and transportation air conditioning systems are a major contributor to global warming. Refrigerants are also used in refrigerators and in units that transport food to keep it cold. They're even used as solvents and in fire protection. 

Currently, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are the most commonly used refrigerant. Though they last only 15 years or less in the atmosphere, they are a major cause of greenhouse gas. The most commonly used HFCs have a capacity 3,000 times greater than carbon dioxide (CO2) to warm the atmosphere. As more people use air conditioning to battle the heat, the more HFCs will be used. The use of refrigerants is expected to grow by 10-15% per year. 

## Progress Made

New refrigerants, commonly referred to as A2L refrigerants for their low toxicity and less flammable properties, are on the horizon. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will require HVAC systems and heat pumps manufactured after January 1, 2025 use A2L refrigerants. Companies all over the United States are preparing for the change.

## Challenges Ahead

Several burgeoning technologies can improve how energy is supplied for refrigeration and for how it is implemented. However, there are drawbacks to each of these technologiesâ€“not the least of which many are new and experimental. They would need improvements to work, especially on a mass scale. 

For example, absorption, a process that uses two fluids and heat input (rather than electricity) to produce a cooling effect, can use ammonia as one of its refrigerants. However, an absorption unit can overheat. Once this happens, the unit cannot be fixed and must be replaced. 

Food retailers are currently reluctant to switch from systems that use HFCs to alternative refrigerants. They cite leakage and performance issues as problems as well as a rocky transition due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The pandemic created supply chain issues, and there is an increase in refrigeration demand along with quality control loss and technician shortages.
