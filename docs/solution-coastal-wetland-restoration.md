## Overview

- **Coastal Wetland Restoration**: Using wetlands against climate change.
- Tech: Green infrastructure, living shorelines, wetland restoration.
- Leading entities: Nature Conservancy, Wetlands Initiative, Environmental Defense Fund.

## Progress Made

- **Breakthroughs**: Green infrastructure, living shorelines, wetland restoration.
- Leading entities: Nature Conservancy, Wetlands Initiative, Environmental Defense Fund, National Wildlife Federation.
- Progress: Tech like carbon capture, green infrastructure, wetlands restoration.
- Entities: Nature Conservancy, EPA, NOAA leading the way.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Site Selection and Characterization**: Proper site choice crucial.
2. **Native Plant Species Use**: Native plants vital, non-native invasive.
3. **Natural Process Integration**: Embrace natural processes for success.
4. **Monitoring and Adaptation**: Monitor and adapt for project success.

## Challenges Ahead

- **High Project Costs**: Expense hinders wider adoption.
- **Long-term Efficacy Data**: Need more research on restoration's effectiveness.
- **Public Awareness Needed**: Lack of understanding about restoration's climate benefits.
- Leading entities: NOAA, EPA, Nature Conservancy involved.

## Best Path Forward

- **Awareness Increase**: Educate policy makers and public on benefits.
- **Research Enhancement**: Improve understanding and guidelines.
- **Financial Support**: Incentives for stakeholders to implement restoration.
- **Effective Monitoring**: Evaluate projects and share findings.

Some companies and organizations that have been at the forefront of coastal wetland restoration include The Nature Conservancy, the Environmental Defense Fund, and the National Wildlife Federation. Progress made in this area includes the restoration of over 3 million acres of coastal wetlands in the United States since the early 1990s.
