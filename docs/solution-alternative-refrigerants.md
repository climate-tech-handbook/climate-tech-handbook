# Alternative Refrigerants

![Cover Image](../static/img/co2-refrigeration.jpg)

Refrigerants are a major contributor to greenhouse gases. This article outlines the changes companies are making to move to greener alternatives for refrigerating our food, homes, and businesses. Companies like Honeywell International and Daikin Industries are helping the world transition to greener systems.

## Overview

As the earth warms, air conditioning is becoming more of a necessity to combat heat waves. However, the refrigerants used in home, commercial, industrial, and transportation air conditioning systems are a major contributor to global warming. Refrigerants are also used in refrigerators and in units that transport food to keep it cold. They're even used as solvents and in fire protection.

Currently, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are the most commonly used refrigerant. Though they last only 15 years or less in the atmosphere, they are a major cause of greenhouse gas emissions. The most commonly used HFCs have a global warming potential (GWP) 3,000 times greater than carbon dioxide (CO2). As more people use air conditioning to battle the heat, the more HFCs will be used. The use of refrigerants is expected to grow by 10-15% per year.

## Environmental Impact

- HFCs are short-lived in the atmosphere but have a very high GWP.
- Refrigerants in landfills produce potent greenhouse gases.
- The production and disposal of refrigerants also contribute to environmental pollution.

## Case Studies

1. **Supermarket Transition to Natural Refrigerants**: A leading supermarket chain in Europe transitioned to natural refrigerants, reducing their GHG emissions by 50% ([European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/f-gas_en)).
2. **Honeywell's Solstice® Refrigerants**: Honeywell's Solstice® line has helped reduce the carbon footprint of HVAC systems by up to 99% ([Honeywell](https://www.honeywell.com)).

## Policy Measures and Regulations

1. **Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol**: A global agreement to phase down HFCs.
2. **EU F-Gas Regulation**: Aims to reduce the EU's F-gas emissions by two-thirds by 2030.
3. **EPA's SNAP Program**: Identifies and approves safer alternatives to high-GWP refrigerants.

## Economic Benefits

- Potential global savings by reducing the need for high-GWP refrigerants.
- Job creation in the development and implementation of alternative refrigerants.
- Reduced costs for businesses in the HVAC and refrigeration sectors.

## Challenges and Best Path Forward

### Challenges
- High initial costs for transitioning to alternative refrigerants.
- Technical challenges in retrofitting existing systems.
- Limited availability of trained technicians for new refrigerant technologies.

### Best Path Forward
1. Increase public awareness through education campaigns.
2. Implement supportive policies and financial incentives.
3. Invest in research and development of low-GWP refrigerants.
4. Improve infrastructure for refrigerant recovery and recycling.
5. Foster collaboration between government, businesses, and consumers.
