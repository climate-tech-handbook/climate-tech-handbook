Join our community by signing up here: Subscribe Hey there and welcome to Climate Drift! Skander here, and today we're diving into the final part (at least for now) on Carbon Offsets. Having explored the and the , we'll now delve into its ongoing evolution. We'll walk you through the offset purchasing process—starting with the traditional Voluntary Carbon market and then to the emerging new market. True to Climate Drift's style, I'll spotlight a company at each phase. Let’s dive in 🌊 Today's article is greatly informed by the insights from this exceptional CTVC post: . I think their observations are a spot on glimpse into the future of offsets, I'll be referencing their post while spotlighting companies and incorporating our own perspectives. We often say we stand on the shoulders of giants, and in this instance, those giants are Sophie Purdom and Kim Zhou. Let’s start with the Legacy Journey: Legacy offset purchasing journey In the traditional market, companies with net zero goals would establish a carbon offset budget, collaborate with brokers to source the most affordable offsets, and then conveniently continue their usual operations, emitting as before. Step 1: Commit to Net Zero It's straightforward: announce publicly, through a press release, your intention to achieve Net Zero emissions by a defined or open-ended date. Step 2: Conduct emissions accounting Following the optimistic announcement of corporate net zero intentions, the next crucial step is to evaluate the company's carbon footprint. This task is intricate and varies widely, especially when using standard emission factors, which can drastically alter a company's carbon footprint assessment. This complexity is why numerous companies seek external consultants. Meanwhile, larger corporations are beginning to form dedicated in-house teams, often spearheaded by passionate existing employees eager to steer their company towards carbon neutrality. Time for an anecdote: I'm aware of a prominent fossil fuel company where the CEO made a bold public declaration about their Net Zero ambitions. However, they then found themselves scrambling to hire over 100 individuals just to gauge the extent of their emissions throughout their value chain. Two years post-announcement, they're still in the process of assembling the team. Spotlight : Established in 2006, South Pole ranks among the top emissions consultancies worldwide. With a team of over 1,200 experts, they've spearheaded projects and built product & tools spanning finance, climate action APIs, and emission reduction & compensation strategies. Their clientele includes banking giants like HSBC and Deutsche Bank, as well as renowned consumer brands such as L’Oreal, Hilton, Danone, and Chanel. Through their network of 30+ global offices, South Pole has directed financing to more than 850 projects. However, recent scrutiny has emerged following a Bloomberg investigation: . For a balanced perspective, consider reading both the investigation and the response from South Pole’s CEO: . Step 3: Purchase carbon offsets. Traditionally, carbon offsets were procured through middlemen called brokers. Acting much like carbon asset managers, these brokers advised companies on curating their carbon offset portfolios and aided in direct carbon credit transactions. Companies would specify their required volume and budget, allowing brokers to secure credits from project creators. However, given these financial limitations, brokers sometimes favored cost-effectiveness over the true quality of the offsets. Now to the Supply Side Registries Registries serve as custodians for certified credits. These often non-profit entities supervise the enlistment and validation of carbon offset initiatives. To attain certification, projects must adhere to the registry's stringent criteria, which includes hands-on validation processes, such as field personnel physically measuring trees. Only after meeting these standards can the credits be listed and exchanged on the registry's platform. Spotlight: Verra deserves an in-depth examination on its own, given its significance. In brief, Verra, established in 2007, operates the world's largest voluntary carbon market program, the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) Program. However, it's currently grappling with alleging an exaggeration of the effects of their verified offsets. Due to overwhelming reader demand there will be a Verra deep dive (soon-ish). Project developers & owners Project developers play a pivotal role where credits and projects converge. They collaborate with landowners to evaluate projects, attract investors, and manage the sale of generated credits. Carbon offsets primarily fall into two categories: renewable energy initiatives and land use projects, such as enhanced forest management. Given their insider knowledge in an otherwise murky market, developers often claim a substantial 20-40% share. Drawing parallels with the renewable energy sector, these developers use intricate 20-tab Excel models to forecast cash flows. However, instead of focusing on electrons, they estimate carbon. The complexity of these calculations provides leeway, allowing developers to potentially overstate assumptions to maximize carbon credit generation. For instance, inflating the growth rate can significantly amplify the projected avoided emissions. Now let’s look at which new players are joining along the value chain. The Evolving Carbon Market Considering the problems that emerged in the traditional market, , there's a growing demand for quality. Many startups have stepped up, introducing advanced tools for carbon management, removal, marketplace, and verification. Step 1: Pledge net zero While not much has shifted, the surge in public awareness and recent lawsuits have made companies realize that their net zero commitments are under scrutiny, comparison, and watchful eyes. Step 2: Software eats emissions accounting An emerging ecosystem of carbon accounting software has rapidly evolved, automating tasks previously handled by consultants using spreadsheets. Spotlight: Emissions-focused companies tailored to specific industries are on the rise, with Measurabl standing out in the ESG data management realm for commercial real estate. With a clientele of over 1,000, Measurabl asserts its use by 40% of global real estate asset managers, overseeing 60,000 commercial properties across 93 countries. The platform streamlines data collection, computes carbon emissions from utilities and transportation, and benchmarks against 55,000 buildings in its database, aiding real estate professionals in identifying efficient versus high-emission properties. Measurabl taps into three pivotal markets: the $1bn ESG data space, the $723bn green debt arena, and the $3.9 trillion building decarbonization sector, as of 2021 figures. In a recent milestone, Measurabl raised $93 million in its Series D funding, bringing its total capital to $170 million. Step 3: Purchase carbon removals - Direct Procurement In the classic direct-to-consumer (D2C) SaaS model, new tech players are allowing companies to purchase carbon credits without the need for brokers or intermediaries. Contrary to the traditional carbon offset market, where credits were issued in the same year the emissions reductions took place, carbon removals are now often marketed as ""future vintages."" For instance, many of Stripe and Microsoft's acquisitions are pledges to back projects that will remove carbon in upcoming years. Spotlight 1: Microsoft Microsoft has set forth one of the boldest corporate climate goals, aiming to be ""carbon negative"" by 2030. However, after a period of decline, their greenhouse gas emissions saw an uptick in the fiscal year 2021 (and a slight fall in 2022), as revealed in their recent sustainability report. The tech giant accounted for approximately 13 million metric tons of CO2 emissions that year, equivalent to the output of around 35 gas-fired power plants. . Msft has been very open with their pledge and their progress towards it. I especially want to highlight their comprehensive yearly reviews of the Carbon Removal program; find the latest one here: Spotlight 2: Shopify You are a company that wants to set up their own Carbon Removal plan? Check out this great guide by Shopify on how they set it up: Supply Side Direct to Purchaser DAC frontrunners like Climeworks and Charm Industrial are beginning to offer direct carbon removal purchasing options. However, due to the limited availability and substantial cost, only affluent individuals and corporations can partake. For instance, to offset the emissions of a single person, Charm charges around $1175/month, while Climeworks demands a heftier $2176/month. Purchase carbon removals - Marketplace and Integrated Verifiers Robert Hoglund described the carbon removal market dynamics as “ ”, noting an abundance of marketplaces but a scarcity of buyers or sellers. Currently, the market is experiencing rapid growth, with numerous entities emerging to cater to niche requirements. I consider this a mushroomy market: a lot of these new marketplaces (mushrooms) pop up and will disappear over time. Spotlight: With offices in London and New York, the startup Isometric has made headlines by securing a whopping $25 million seed funding from venture capital giants like Lowercarbon Capital and Plural. This investment ranks among the most substantial seed rounds for a climate-focused startup this year. Founder Eamon Jubbawy encapsulated the company's mission, stating, “The carbon registries that existed missed the mark so badly that the only real option was to build another platform to fix all that, focused on removal,” Isometric's vision is clear: to be a one-stop registry that streamlines the carbon credit purchasing journey. They select partners for data gathering and modeling, ensuring a seamless transition to the final credit issuance. A core part of their mission is to counteract market fragmentation, which they identify as a looming threat to effective carbon removal. Their strategy is anchored in four key pillars: Scientific Rigor: They prioritize in-depth scientific metrics, outpacing conventional carbon markets. This is achieved through an in-house science team and collaborations with a broad spectrum of scientists. Incentive Alignment: By levying a fee on carbon removal buyers for credit verification, they ensure unbiased CDR quality assessments. Transparency: Isometric is committed to making carbon removal data accessible to all, from laypersons to industry specialists. Collaboration: They foster partnerships with scientists, academic bodies, startups, and tech firms, aiming to unify measurement, verification, and credit purchase processes.

Stay tuned for our last piece, where we'll explore the market's ongoing evolution. Let’s dive in 🌊 Carbon Offset Explained - Part The Great Carbon Offset Scam Since the landmark COP26 summit in Glasgow in November 2021, the landscape of the carbon offset market has undergone considerable changes. Nature-based offsets, which predominantly focus on tree-planting projects or incentives to deter deforestation, emerged as the preferred offset type. Yet, as tides go, their prices have nosedived by an astonishing 90%. The reason behind this drastic decline? An overwhelming amount of research and documentation, turning the public opinion. associated with Carbon Offsets, casting doubts on their credibility and effectiveness. One of the big decisive moments happened this January: The UK's Guardian, Germany's Die Zeit, and research organization Source Materials collaborated on an extensive . Their focus was on what were previously deemed high-quality offsets aimed at preserving the Brazilian rainforest. Notably, these offsets were purchased by major corporations like Shell, Disney, and Gucci. Shockingly, their research unveiled that a staggering 94% of these offsets held no real value. Don’t believe fake news? In 2016 the European Commission commissioned a study on the Clean Development Mechanism. After evaluating hundreds of projects, the Commission determined that a mere 2% met high-quality standards. The lawyers wake up This shift in public opinion also awoke a new force on the climate action field: lawyers. In the past 12 to 18 months, there has been a surge in such lawsuits. These legal actions typically fall into two categories. The most prevalent type involves approaching the advertising regulator of a country, accusing companies of false advertising. For example, the Swiss regulator recently determined that the 2022 World Cup in Qatar's claim of being ""carbon neutral"" was misleading. Kicking the carbon-neutral ball In 2019, the world's two leading credit agencies, Verra and the Gold Standard, made a pivotal decision. They resolved not to endorse any offset projects funding renewables unless they were based in extremely impoverished nations. Why? Because that these projects would have happened either way.  Consequently, a vast majority of projects were left unverified and halted. However, as the Voluntary Carbon Markets are unregulated, Qatar took matters into its own hands. They established their own offset verification agency, openly welcoming any renewable project for accreditation. And guess who became a very big customer of this new verification agency? And that is how the World Cup became carbon neutral. This tactic is now being copied by numerous other high-emission entities. Recently, Saudi Arabia established its own verification agency and has begun issuing offsets to its oil and gas sectors. But the lawsuits are not stopping. There have been lawsuits in the Dutch court because Shell keeps trying to claim that its oil is carbon neutral or somehow good for the environment, and they've lost four times in a row. Last autumn, Evian faced legal scrutiny when their water bottles were labeled as ""carbon neutral."" They are currently being sued over this claim. In late June, Delta Airlines was sued in a federal court in California for proclaiming itself as the world's first carbon neutral airline. The plaintiff argued that they purchased the ticket under the impression that Delta was actively addressing climate issues, only to discover they weren't. This has led brands like Nestle to proactively take a step back, announcing that they will retract any carbon-neutral claims for products like Kit Kat and Perrier water. The situation has escalated to such an extent that law firms have started sending advisories to their clients this year, warning them of the potential legal risks in the offset domain A long list of problems I think the Trust issue is well understood now. Unfortunately we are running out of essay space, so let’s give a quick summary of all the other problems with Carbon Offsets: Additionality: Main question: Would the emissions reduction have occurred without the offset funding? In a nutshell : If a credit is granted for a permanently protected forest reserve, then that offset isn't truly ""additional"" since the forest was already preserved. This is especially relevant for renewable energy projects. With the significant decrease in renewable energy costs over the years, it's evident that many projects would have proceeded without offset funds. Thus, buyers shouldn't receive credit for inevitable actions. Leakage: Main Question: How likely is it for greenhouse gas-emitting activities to shift from the project site to another location? In a nutshell: If an offset aims to protect a section of the Amazon from soy cultivation-related deforestation, but another section gets deforested for soy, then the offset merely caused ""leakage."" Another example: if I own a forest, I might sell you the offsets to prevent deforestation in Area A. However, I could then proceed to deforest Area B. The result? The same number of trees are cut down, even after you've paid to protect Area A. The net emissions remain unchanged. Verification: Main Question: Is the offset verified using a recognized registry and a scientifically-backed approach? In a nutshell: Traditional verification agencies like Verra have proven unreliable. In this unregulated market, setting up counterfeit verification agencies is feasible. Moreover, verifying new removal methods, such as , can be complex and slow, hindering actual emission reductions. Permanence: Main Question: How likely is it for stored carbon to be released back into the atmosphere? In a nutshell: Is the storage actually long term. How can we account for variations in storage stability due to intentional actions or unforeseen events like extreme weather and external factors? - an overview of permanence issues across different types of carbon offsets. Double Selling Issue : Net Zero is an accounting issue afterall In May, the Danish government disclosed a deal with the bioenergy company Ørsted to implement carbon capture systems on two biomass plants in Denmark. This would capture up to 450,000 tons of CO2 annually, storing it beneath the Norwegian sea. Denmark funded this initiative through a dedicated carbon removal and capture fund. Consequently, Denmark is accounting for these tons in its national greenhouse gas inventory. Unlike forest-based offsets, these reductions are verifiable and more permanent. These emissions originated from Danish power plants, aligning with Denmark's commitment under the Paris agreement to reduce emissions. However, the issue arose when Ørsted revealed that it was selling over half of these tons, which Denmark had already claimed, to Microsoft. Microsoft contributed financially and is using these tons to offset its corporate emissions The same carbon credits are being double-sold and double-claimed. Ørsted's stance is: It's not an issue; it's merely two distinct accounting methods. Net Zero is an accounting problem after all. So what have we learned today? 94% of offsets purchased by major corporations are worthless. There is a surge in lawsuits against companies falsely advertising carbon neutrality, such as the 2022 World Cup in Qatar and Shell. We also have an overview of the major problems: Additionality, Leakage, Verification, Permanence, and Double Selling. The current voluntary carbon offset market allows companies to offset Net Zero emissions at a minimal cost. But the market is evolving rapidly, and in the next part we will see how a voluntary market might be created that brings actual emissions reductions.

Climate Drift,Carbon Offsets Explained: Part 1,An origin Story,"As we delve deeper into the Carbon Removal Hype Curve, let's pause for a moment to demystify Carbon Offsets. Rather than a brief overview, we'll be taking a deeper dive, spanning several parts: In this initial part, we'll explore the origin of offsets, encompassing both the public and voluntary markets. Next, we'll shine a light on the numerous problems with offsets. Finally, we'll observe how the market is currently evolving to solve these problems. Let’s dive in 🌊 Carbon Offsets Explained: Part 1 An origin Story Net Zero: only an accounting problem? The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) asserts that by 2030, the world must halve its human-induced CO2 emissions to stand a chance of mitigating the most severe impacts of climate change. By 2050, achieving a ""net-zero"" balance between emissions and their removal is crucial to uphold this probability. How do offsets and their accounting fit into the picture? By standard definition, offsets refer to the reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in one location to counterbalance emissions elsewhere. Here's a common scenario: Instead of a developed nation or a corporation cutting down its own CO2 emissions, it funds a developing nation to do so, matching the emission amount. If the purchasing entity acquires enough offsets, they often label themselves as 'carbon neutral' or 'net zero'. You might have encountered this: Say you're booking a flight, and you're given an option to offset your journey's entire carbon footprint for a surprisingly low fee. Sounds too good to be true? That's because it often is. In the next part we will dive into the reasons behind this skepticism. But first, let's trace back to the origins of the offset concept. Offsets and politicians Three primary policy strategies can be implemented to significantly decrease net carbon emissions: First is Carbon Taxation , which involves levying taxes on activities and products with high carbon emissions. Economists widely believe that carbon taxes are the most effective and efficient method to reduce emissions without significantly harming the economy. To ensure these taxes don't disproportionately burden the less affluent, the revenue generated should be channeled to assist those most impacted by the taxes. Currently, 25 nations have adopted carbon taxes, and 46 countries have established some form of carbon pricing, either through taxes or emission trading systems. However there is a major problem: Introducing new taxes is rarely popular among constituents, making it a contentious issue for elected officials. Second is Carbon Trading , a system that limits carbon emissions by distributing carbon permits. Carbon trading can foster innovation and reduce costs, making renewable energy and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) economically feasible. Some trading schemes permit businesses to purchase carbon offsets, either domestically or internationally, to balance out their emissions. Lastly, Carbon Offsetting refers to actions taken to counterbalance emissions produced in one area by reducing emissions elsewhere. This can be achieved through initiatives like reforestation or by shutting down high-emission sources like coal power plants. Two primary offsetting frameworks exist: the UN's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and the voluntary market. The CDM supports UN-accredited projects in developing countries that yield greenhouse gas reductions. We will look at this one and its origin first. History of Carbon Offsets Today, national or regional carbon trading schemes cover over 13% of global carbon emissions. These systems are operational in countries like the USA, Canada, China, and regions like the EU. However, it's worth noting that the US lacks a national carbon market, with California being the sole state boasting a formal cap-and-trade program. In 1977, the US Clean Air Act pioneered one of the earliest tradable emission offset systems. Under this mechanism, a company could increase its emissions if it compensated by funding a more significant emission reduction at another facility. Fast forward to 1990, amendments to the Act birthed the Acid Rain Trading Program, introducing the ""cap and trade"" concept. Here, emission limits for pollutants would gradually tighten, but within these confines, companies could trade offsets resulting from emission-reducing investments. And it did work out: A shining example is the US's success in curbing sulfur dioxide and N2O emissions with the Clean Air Act . While initial projections estimated a $7.4 billion cost, actual data in 1998 revealed it was under $1 billion. Carbon trading has thus garnered significant attention from policymakers, with many championing regional or global trading systems. If it worked for SO2 and NOX, why not for the other greenhouse gases? Introducing: Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) In the early 2000s, carbon offsets gained momentum with the introduction of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) by the UN. Established under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, an international climate agreement, the CDM is an offset scheme aimed to assist developed nations in achieving their greenhouse gas reduction targets. At the same time, it promoted sustainable growth in developing countries. As outlined by the UN, the CDM enabled nations with emission-reduction objectives to partially fulfill these commitments by purchasing Certified Emission Reductions (CERs). Each CER corresponds to a reduction or avoidance of one tonne of CO2 emissions in developing nations. For instance, if Germany pledged to cut emissions by 100 million tons (MT), they could invest in a renewable energy project in China projected to offset 10 MT. This would mean Germany would then only need to curtail their domestic CO2 emissions by 90 MT to achieve their target. Spotlight on Europe: The European Union's Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) is a beacon in the world of carbon trading, boasting the title of the most extensive and seasoned system of its kind. The ETS is comprehensive, covering sectors from electricity generation to various manufacturing industries like pulp, paper, and glass. Its reach is impressive, operating across 31 countries, which includes all 28 EU member states and extends to Iceland, Norway, and Liechtenstein. In terms of its impact, the ETS addresses a significant chunk of the EU's emissions, handling half of its CO2 output and 40% of its total greenhouse gas emissions. The system operates on the 'cap and trade' model. Here's how it works: a ceiling is set for greenhouse gas emissions for each country's installations. These installations are then given emission 'allowances', which can either be auctioned or allocated freely, and these allowances can be traded. The installations have a responsibility to ensure their emissions don't exceed their allowances. If they do, they need to buy more. If they've been efficient, they can sell their surplus. The ETS has evolved in phases: 2005-07, 2008-12, 2013-20, and 2021-30. With each phase, the system has tightened its grip, reducing the available credits and roping in more sectors. This progressive approach aims to drive rapid emission reductions. However, no system is without its critiques. Detractors have pointed out issues like over-allocation, windfall profits, price volatility, and, more broadly, the system's failure to meet its primary objectives: The initial lack of governance and oversight led to some unintended consequences. The system inadvertently incentivized actions that, while technically within the rules, didn't align with the spirit of environmental conservation. A glaring example was the production and subsequent destruction of fluorocarbons (like those found in refrigerators). These compounds are potent contributors to global warming. The ETS allowed companies to claim credits for destroying them. However, it didn't prevent companies from producing these harmful compounds solely to destroy them later, essentially gaming the system. This loophole led to a bizarre situation where factories would produce these harmful gases only to destroy them at the end of the production line , ironically emitting more greenhouse gases in the process. Despite these challenges, the EU ETS has had its successes. A 2023 study highlighted a commendable 10% reduction in carbon emissions from 2005 to 2012, without any negative impact on the profits or employment of regulated firms. By February 2023, the price of EU allowances even soared past 100€/tCO2 (equivalent to $118). Supporters argue that the initial phase (2005-2007) of the EU ETS was more of a ""learning phase."" It was designed to set benchmarks and lay the groundwork for a carbon market, rather than achieve drastic emission reductions. This perspective underscores the importance of iterative learning, as described in : What about the voluntary market? What's surprising about the voluntary carbon market is that despite the significant media coverage, it remains relatively small in scale. In fact, the total amount of offsets from 1988 to 2005 was about $300 million. Since then it has grown: Last year, in 2022, its transacted value was a few billion dollars. In stark contrast, the compliance markets are valued at approximately $850 billion, with the European emissions trading scheme being a dominant player. The voluntary market however operated without regulations, and history shows that unregulated markets often spiral into a race to the bottom. Imagine being a major corporation aiming for Net Zero. If one vendor offers you a quality carbon offset from Brazil at $20 a ton, but another pitches it at $5 a ton, which would you choose? This setup creates a skewed market dynamic. Sellers are driven to undercut prices, while buyers are on the hunt for the cheapest deal. In this equation, there's no motivation for either party to prioritize quality. Without regulatory oversight or penalties for subpar offerings, both sides are incentivized to compromise on quality in favor of cost savings. Enter: Carbon Neutral Marketing Over time, carbon credits evolved to serve a new purpose, which can best be described as ""brand storytelling."" Instead of purchasing credits primarily for compliance or tax benefits, companies began acquiring them for marketing advantages. By buying these credits, businesses could proclaim a status of carbon neutrality, prominently displaying this commitment on their vehicles, advertisements, and product labels. This became their unique selling proposition derived from the credits. This trend continues today. Consider the numerous airlines offering passengers the option to offset their carbon footprint for a nominal fee, calculated based on the flight distance. Time to set standards As an economist, I appreciate the market's innate ability to self-regulate [Disclaimer: One of my editors pointed out that I should point out that his is irony]. This manifested itself in the carbon credit arena with the emergence of multiple standard-setting bodies, each striving to elevate beyond the foundational blueprint of the CDM for the voluntary market. Among these, two entities stand out: Verra, which is perhaps the most recognized, and the Gold Standard. In the next part we will start by looking at the failure of these standard bodies to set good standards, leading to the Great Carbon Offset Scam. As we delve deeper, it becomes evident that while carbon offset systems offer potential, they grapple with significant challenges, especially concerning governance and oversight. The voluntary market, though smaller in scale, underscores the perils of a laissez-faire approach. Here, the quest for cost-efficiency might eclipse the overarching objective of authentic carbon reduction. Armed with this historical context, we'll now explore the problems with offsets. Let's dive in.

Climate Drift,The Guide to the Carbon Removal Hype - Part 3,__ Rocks and Storage ___,"The Guide to the Carbon Removal Hype - Part 3 In our Solutions Map we have 28 solution pathways for Carbon Removal mapped out. These are the 16 solutions we will look at through the Hype Cycle. A note on categorisation Historically, attempts have been made by academics and experts to classify solutions as natural versus engineered or nature-based versus non-nature-based. While these classifications provide a general direction, they often fall short in capturing the nuances, especially when many solutions cross both categories. A more recent classification differentiates between Organic and Inorganic solutions, but even here, there's considerable overlap. For clarity in this discussion, I'll use the terms ""Nature-Based"" and ""Engineered."" If anyone has a more precise framework, I'm open to suggestions and will make necessary updates. Nature Based: These are mature, well-established practices already in widespread use ( ) and are frequently reported by nations under their Land Use, Land Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF) activities. This category includes methods such as afforestation/reforestation, soil carbon in croplands and grasslands, peatland and wetland restoration, agroforestry, improved forest management, and the use of durable Harvested Wood Products. Engineered: Generally at a , these methods are currently deployed at smaller scales. Examples include BECCS, Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage (DACCS), biochar and ocean alkalinisation. Engineered solutions are very early How early? CDR from novel methods contributes 0.1% of current deployment. Conventional CDR on land accounts for over 99%. With that: let’s see how we can improve current CDR. Enhanced Weathering Overview : Enhanced rock weathering bridges the gap between natural processes and human intervention. It amplifies the slow, natural weathering of rocks to expedite carbon removal. Historically, volcanic rocks and cliffs have incrementally captured carbon as they weathered under the influence of rain. Enhanced rock weathering, by fragmenting these rocks, optimizes their exposure to rain, thus fast-tracking the weathering and carbon capture processes. Carbon mineralization is a method where CO2 interacts with alkaline substances [also ] resulting in the formation of solid carbonate minerals. This phenomenon naturally transpires in alkaline environments when atmospheric CO2 binds with certain rocks, producing carbonates. Surficial techniques emphasize natural weathering, utilizing byproducts like mine tailings or industrial residues. Research indicates that specific mine tailings have a notable capacity for CO2 capture. While ambitious strategies aiming to extract billions of tonnes of CO2 annually through surficial weathering of alkaline wastes and mined materials are being explored academically, they are yet to be tested on a pilot scale. The Technology Readiness Level (TRL) is currently estimated to be between 3 and 5. Current production rates suggest that solid industrial alkaline wastes have the potential to store up to 1.5 GtCO2 annually, with projections reaching 3 GtCO2 in the future. Despite the promise, challenges such as environmental impacts of mining, air quality issues, and potential heavy metal contamination persist. However, a silver lining is that some techniques can neutralize soil acidity, promoting healthier plant growth and increased soil carbon storage. Spotlight : Heirloom claims it can achieve carbon dioxide removal at $50 a ton at commercial scale, . The company aims to extract 1 billion tons of CO2 by 2035. Frontier committed to buy 250 tons of carbon removal from Heirloom at $2,054 per ton. with their partners Climeworks and Battelle they were also just selected as one of the DAC hubs of the US Department of Energy. Heirloom uses enhanced weathering directly: minerals, such as calcium oxide from ground limestone, are spread on sheets and exposed to air. These minerals rapidly bond with atmospheric CO2. With enhancements, Heirloom believes this bonding can occur in two weeks, compared to the typical year. Heirloom's process then involves heating these materials to 400-900 ˚C, releasing CO2, akin to cement production. They could also use other materials like magnesite. The company plans to use electricity-driven kilns, ensuring the process is powered by renewable energy. This produces pure CO2, which can be captured and stored underground indefinitely. However, using electricity for this process is currently costlier than using coal or natural gas. The carbon removal benefits are also contingent on the electricity source being carbon-neutral. Questions remain about Heirloom's ability to expedite the bonding process, which impacts its economic viability. Heirloom plans to sell carbon removal credits, anticipating increased demand as costs drop and policies favor carbon removal. CO2 Storage As Terraform Now points out: We have the geological storage we need to store all emissions in 2050. Storage is the only long term choice for CO2, as it needs to counteract the effect of emissions lingering in the atmosphere for hundreds of thousands of years. That said, many companies operating in 2023 are excited about what the industry calls “utilization” of the CO2. There are many existing industrial use cases for CO2, including carbonating soda, producing recycled fuels, and manufacturing fertilizer. But what happens if we can store it permanently in a resource we will need a lot of? Spotlight : Concrete is the second most consumed material on Earth after water. Its primary component, cement, is a major environmental concern, contributing to 8% of global CO2 emissions. This is over triple the emissions from the aviation sector. By 2060, cement usage is projected to double. Cement clinker, essential for concrete, is a significant source of these greenhouse gas emissions. This time I am highlighting a promising smaller startup from Berlin: EcoLocked. In 2021, they began exploring scalable and economically viable applications for biocarbon, a carbon-sequestering material. Their research led them to the cement and concrete industry. Here, refined biocarbon can act as an efficient additive to reduce concrete's carbon footprint. EcoLocked has since pioneered CO2-neutral, medium-strength concrete mixes, validated through in-house, third-party, and industry partner testing. Today, biocarbon production is already scalable, highly efficient, and cost-effective. This efficiency stems from utilizing waste materials, maintaining low operational costs, and recycling surplus pyrolysis gas. Its vast potential spans industries such as agriculture, water filtration, and notably, construction. EcoLocked is a proud member of the Alliance for Low Carbon Cement & Concrete. Learn more at . Wrapping up Part 3, I hope you found our deeper exploration into Carbon Removal enlightening. 3 things to take away from today: - We can speed up the carbon capture process by fragmenting rocks - We've got the geological storage to handle 2050 emissions - Cement's a big CO2 culprit. But we can make it part of the solution. Let’s dial in next time for more solutions on the Carbon Removal Curve.

Want to explore the hype curve of transportation solutions instead? Start with our Transportation Part 1: Transportation Part 2: Transportation Part 3: Tree Engineering Overview: Tree planting is widely championed as a climate solution, uniting scientists, politicians, and billionaires. However, its effectiveness is debated. Some studies suggest without proper care, these forests can die, releasing stored carbon. Moreover, seedling shortages can hinder projects. While trees are vital, they aren't the sole climate answer. A pressing question arises: can we enhance trees' carbon storage capacity? 🌳 The Tree-Planting Conundrum While the idea of simply planting more trees and preserving existing forests sounds straightforward, the reality is more complex. Scale of the Problem: The sheer volume of CO2 we emit annually is staggering. To offset even a fraction of current emissions, we'd need to plant trees on a scale that's logistically challenging. How many new trees would we need to offset our carbon emissions? One answer is 640 Trees per person, so around 200 billion new trees - but . Land Use Competition: Land is a finite resource. As the global population grows, so does the demand for land for agriculture, housing, and infrastructure. Dedicating vast tracts of land solely for tree planting can lead to conflicts over land use priorities. Biomass for Energy and Sequestration: Many net-zero strategies lean heavily on biomass, both as an energy source and for carbon capture (processes like BECCS and BiCRS). However, the practicality of these solutions is questionable. Using large amounts of biomass for energy can divert it from other essential uses, like food production. Tree Growth Rate: Trees take time to mature and reach their full carbon sequestration potential. We're racing against time to mitigate climate change, and waiting decades for trees to grow might not be the most efficient strategy. Sustainability and Measurement Concerns: Forestry-based carbon removal is facing increasing scrutiny due to concerns about its sustainability, longevity, and even the accuracy of its measurement. A recent analysis by the non-profit CarbonPlan revealed that California's forest offset program, the largest of its kind, overestimated the actual carbon removed from forestry by nearly 30%. Solution: Not all trees we plant survive. But we can use engineering and other plants to make them survive longer. taps into the potential of locally-sourced mycorrhizal fungi to optimize tree planting results. Rhizocore's focus on soil integration by introducing fungi to young trees, significantly reducing sapling mortality rates often attributed to inadequate soil connectivity. Their method not only accelerates woodland recovery but also boosts forest productivity, offering a viable pathway for reforestation and enhancing the trees' capacity for long-term carbon storage. Their fungi-infused pellets catalyze a 20% growth acceleration in young trees. As climate change threatens more frequent droughts over the next 30-40 years, Rhizocore's method ensures enhanced drought resistance. Ocean alkalinity Overview: The ocean, earth's largest carbon sink, holds around 40 trillion tonnes of dissolved carbon. This carbon exists primarily as bicarbonate ions, balanced with dissolved cations. Natural weathering processes release these cations, reacting with CO2 in the atmosphere. Leveraging the ocean for CDR offers multiple benefits: The ocean possesses an immense capacity for CO2 sequestration. Ocean-based CDR doesn't vie for land space, unlike other methods. It enhances and fast-tracks inherent carbon sequestration processes. The ocean's role in the carbon cycle is pivotal. While it's destined to store most of our carbon emissions, natural processes are too slow to impact our immediate climate trajectory. Enhancing the ocean's carbon uptake rate is crucial, especially if emissions cease. The great news: Ocean Alkalization employs simple technology yet promises substantial impact. Alkalinity enhancement has high potential with few limitations. It involves the natural weathering of alkaline minerals, increasing seawater pH and shifting carbonate chemistry equilibrium. This process draws more atmospheric CO2 into the ocean. The good thing is: we are doing it already. Currently, ocean alkalinity enhancement is used to counteract ocean acidification's effects on shell-forming organisms. If applied globally, ocean alkalinity could store trillions of tonnes of CO2 without surpassing historical carbonate saturation levels. However, the storage potential is influenced by atmospheric CO2 levels and technological constraints. The environmental impacts, dependent on distribution methods, might not be evenly spread across the ocean. Elevated alkalinity can impact ecosystems and promote biological carbonate formation, potentially releasing CO2. The implications of this method, including potential ecosystem shifts and impacts on marine biota, require further research and understanding. For more: by Antonius Gagern and Lydia Kapsenberg of the Climateworks foundation Lighthouse: Ocean alkalinization is currently positioned at TRL 1-2. Rather than spotlighting a company, let’s look at a R&D initiative: . This 5-year research and development program is grounded on the belief that Carbon Dioxide Removal is essential for achieving global climate targets, that ocean alkalinity enhancement is a standout strategy within CDR, though it comes with its set of challenges, and that a coordinated non-profit R&D effort is the optimal approach to transparently and safely advance the associated science and technology. This year, they allocated $23M in grants to research institutions and startups to push the boundaries of science and to develop preliminary prototypes for secure deployment. They are establishing dedicated research sites to facilitate controlled field experiments, essential for Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV). Rhizocore's fungi-infused pellets and ocean alkalinization present promising avenues to enhance carbon sequestration of natural processes. However we are at the very beginning of this experiment, and these solutions come with their own sets of challenges and implications that need thorough research and understanding. The ""Carbon to Sea"" initiative exemplifies the kind of coordinated, forward-thinking organisation required to advance and test these solutions. Next time we will continue along the hype curve and look at Enhanced Weathering and CO2 Storage.

Now, let's zoom out and get a panoramic view of the entire Carbon Removal Landscape. Dive deeper into the acquisition here: A quick emissions recap: Since 1850, CO2 levels have skyrocketed by 50%, moving from 280 ppm to 420 ppm, with the majority of this increase occurring in recent times. Our penchant for burning resources has not only released greenhouse gases like CO2 and CH4 but also introduced other detrimental pollutants. To keep global temperatures under 1.5°C, proactive carbon removal is non-negotiable. The IPCC emphasizes that mere emission reductions won't cut it; we need to actively pull CO2 out of the atmosphere. By mid-century, the goal is to strike a balance between minimizing emissions and ramping up carbon removal. In this series, we'll navigate the vast expanse of the carbon removal domain, from nature-based and technological CO2 capture methods to CO2 transportation, storage, utilization, and Carbon Offsets. Let’s dive in 🌊 Core Idea: Carbon capture's premise is straightforward: extract greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and securely store them, mitigating global warming effects. Among greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (CO2) is the primary target due to its prevalence compared to methane, nitrous oxide, and others. Hence, most viable greenhouse gas capture initiatives prioritize CO2. We need a lot of Carbon Removal to hit our goals. Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) serves three pivotal roles alongside emission cutbacks: In the short term, CDR helps decrease net emissions. In the medium term, it offsets lingering emissions, aiming for net-zero CO2 or overall greenhouse gas emissions. Over an extended period, when removal surpasses emissions, CDR can lead to net-negative emissions. But why hasn't this urgent need birthed a booming market? The answer lies in the lack of viable products. While CO2 extraction in submarines and spacecraft is a technology seven decades old, direct atmospheric CO2 removal was sidelined for years. Serious endeavors in CO2 removal began only recently, and it's a challenging task. Given CO2's sparse concentration (0.04% of air), its capture demands significant energy and cost. With no clientele ready to invest, pioneering solutions struggled to find backers. Enter the Carbon Removal boom This changed over the last years and now Carbon Removal is very in: Research is trending: CDR-related studies constitute just under 4% of climate change scientific literature. However, this segment is expanding rapidly, with an annual growth rate of 19% from 1990 to 2021. The number of yearly publications is set to double every 3-4 years. Market Demand: From a demand perspective, Frontier stands out prominently. It functions as an advanced market commitment (AMC) designed to fast-track the evolution of carbon removal technologies by assuring future demand. By sending a robust demand signal, Frontier aims to motivate researchers, entrepreneurs, and investors. Supported by industry titans such as Stripe, Alphabet, Shopify, Meta, McKinsey, and many businesses through Stripe Climate, Frontier has pledged to buy over $1B worth of permanent carbon removal between 2022 and 2030. Government Support: Between 2010 and 2022, global public investment in CDR Research, Development, and Demonstration (RD&D) reached around $4.1 billion. Most of this funding is region-specific. For instance, the U.S.'s proposed Direct Air Capture (DAC) demonstration hubs account for a significant chunk ($3.5 billion). However, many nations are now initiating their own CDR programs. Investment: From 2020 to 2022, investments in new CDR capabilities amounted to roughly $200 million. The majority of these investments are directed towards DACCS, followed by biochar. The Carbon Removal sector now boasts numerous dedicated VC funds and accelerators, such as . The Elon Musk-sponsored XPRIZE Carbon Removal attracted 1132 teams. Out of these, 60 were shortlisted, and 15 secured a million-dollar milestone prize. Public Awareness: Public discourse on CDR, as evidenced by Twitter activity, has surged in the past decade. Daily tweets on CDR jumped from 15 in 2010 to 350 in 2021. While this is significantly less than the 10,000 daily tweets on general climate change, the growth rate for CDR discussions is notably higher. But what how do we define Carbon Removal? 3 Principles for Carbon Removal Principle 1: Atmospheric Origin of CO2 The CO2 captured should be sourced directly from the atmosphere and not from fossil origins. This capture can be direct or indirect, such as through biomass or seawater. Principle 2: Durable Storage Once captured, the CO2 storage should be long-lasting, ensuring that the carbon doesn't quickly re-enter the atmosphere. Principle 3: Human-Driven Intervention The carbon removal process should be a direct result of deliberate human actions, going beyond what Earth's natural processes would achieve on their own. And thus, Oxy's Net Zero Oil doesn't qualify as Carbon Removal, as it contradicts Principle 2. One more thing: Durability It's crucial for storage to have an extended lifespan, ideally aiming for permanence. Why is this so vital? Consider this: a single CO2 emission lingers in the atmosphere for hundreds of thousands of years. It might not be eternal, but it's an incredibly long time. To effectively counteract this emission with removal, the removal must be equally enduring. Average duration per storage The underlying rationale for emphasizing durability in net zero efforts is simple: emissions are essentially permanent. This also underscores the significance of avoided emissions, which can be viewed as permanent removals. This is a testament to the importance of decarbonization and why it should remain a top priority. On a practical note, it's worth mentioning that, with current technology, we can achieve emission removals that are less durable at a much lower cost. On second thought: 7 more things Durability isn't the sole criterion that matters. Let’s take the 7 criteria directly from Frontier: Zooming out: Solutions 28 solution pathways in Carbon Removal from our Solutions Map In this series, we'll journey through the world of carbon removal, exploring everything from nature-driven to engineering-based CO2 capture techniques, as well as CO2 transportation, storage, utilization, and Carbon Offsets. Carbon removal strategies come with their unique strengths, costs, longevity, and storage mechanisms, tailoring them to specific roles. For example, DACCS directly extracts CO2 from the atmosphere and, paired with geological storage, provides an almost everlasting solution by securely burying carbon deep below the earth's surface for millennia. Conversely, forests act as natural CO2 sponges, storing it in their biomass. However, they face threats like decomposition, fires, and other environmental factors over time. This positions afforestation and reforestation as solutions with moderate longevity. While they're often more budget-friendly, their potential is bound by available land. To sum it up, each approach is a comprehensive system, segmented into distinct parts, together forming a rich tapestry of carbon removal solutions. This core comprehension of each potential approach paves the way for the discussions ahead. Numerous questions remain unanswered in this field. So much so that Frontier and RMI have taken the initiative to maintain a database dedicated to the Hype Curve of Carbon Removal Over the coming days, we'll delve into 16 carbon removal technologies spanning the breadth of the Carbon Removal landscape. This served as a small introduction to set the stage for our deep dive into solutions. For a more comprehensive deepdives, please read to: - - - In conclusion, the urgency and complexity of carbon removal cannot be overstated. Carbon Removal has just now emerged as a promising avenue. The recent surge in research, market demand, government support, and public awareness indicates a acknowledgment of its potential, as did last week’s . However, it's crucial to understand that CDR isn't a silver bullet. As we delve deeper, it becomes clear that each technology needs to be reviewed carefully.

Climate Drift,Why Carbon Engineering's $1 Billion Acquisition is the Best & the Worst for Climate Tech - Part 2,"The good, the bad and the public opinion","The last time we checked in on Oxy and Carbon Engineering, Oxy had taken their 4-year collaboration up a notch by straight-up purchasing Carbon Engineering with a $1.1 billion in cash. So is this good or bad? It might be tempting to paint this narrative as ""Big Oil snaps up a small climate tech startup for a green PR move."" That's one perspective we'll explore in the ""Worst Thing"" section. But before we dive into that, let's don our optimistic hats and rose-colored glasses to consider why this might be the best thing to ever happen for climate tech. Best Thing: Let's dive into six reasons why this could be a good thing: Scaling up is essential, but it comes with a hefty price tag We're all on the same page: net zero is the goal. To even stand a chance at hitting the 1.5-degree target, we need a significant amount of Carbon Capture. But scaling up to make a global impact on CO2? That's a monumental financial challenge. The costs are almost beyond comprehension. So, where's that funding going to come from? Bridging this might require teaming up with industry titans, like Oxy. Oxy isn't playing small either. Their current strategy envisions a network of carbon-capture sites, with ambitions to build close to 100 plants powered by Carbon Engineering’s direct air capture (DAC) tech. Fossil fuel giants aren't vanishing overnight Here's a reality check: Fossil fuel companies are here to stay. They won't just disappear in a snap. So, in a world aiming for net zero, what's their play? Historically, when these giants set climate goals, it's often translated to a shift towards renewables, perhaps even a pledge to reduce oil output down the line. BP's setting up wind turbines, Shell's diving deep into hydrogen, and Total's investing big in lithium-ion batteries. But Oxy? They've taken a distinct path, one that resonates with their core expertise and strategy. Having a long-standing focus on using CO2 to extract more oil ( ), Oxy might now pivot to direct sequestration. This acquisition isn't an isolated move either. It's part of a trend, as evidenced by another major CCS deal: Exxon Mobil's recent $4.9 billion purchase of CO2 pipeline operator Denbury. A success story of a fossil giant shifting green is Ørsted. Originally known as Dansk Naturgas A/S, this state-owned Danish company was established in 1972 to oversee gas and oil resources in the Danish North Sea. However, they managed a successful shift to wind energy. Fast forward to today, Ørsted boasts about 30% of the global offshore wind power capacity, excluding mainland China. They generate 90% of their energy from renewable sources and aim to push that to over 95% by 2023 and 99% by 2025. It's worth noting that Ørsted fully committed to this transformation, divesting from gas and oil to wholeheartedly embrace their new direction. Harnessing Technical Know-How & Repurposing Oil & Gas Talent Who's better equipped with the expertise and infrastructure to store CO2 underground than those already in the industry? Consider this: Oxy boasts a workforce of 11,618, while Carbon Engineering operates with just 151. Imagine the potential if even a third of Oxy's vast team were to pivot their passion towards DAC, discovering a renewed purpose in this technology. That's a potential influx of around 4,000 seasoned professionals with deep industry insights. The ripple effect could be profound: these experts sharing their knowledge, some branching out to launch new DAC ventures, or joining other energy behemoths in their green transitions. A lot of climate tech people will make money from this, creating a network of angels Get ready for the Carbon Engineering Mafia. Ever heard of the PayPal Mafia? It's a term for former PayPal folks who went on to kickstart major tech companies like Tesla, LinkedIn, Palantir, SpaceX, YouTube, and more. Now, think about the 150-strong team at Carbon Engineering who've likely hit a financial jackpot. This influx of cash for these individuals could spark a similar trend, with them branching out to launch or back new ventures. Given the current ice cold venture market, this fresh capital, which could be reinvested by next year, might just be the gust of wind that climate solution startups desperately need. Either you compete or have a golden exit Regardless of opinions on the sell-out aspect, this move has bolstered confidence across the sector. DAC companies now have tangible proof of a profitable exit strategy. Inspired by this beacon of success, individuals will be drawn to DAC firms next year, gaining insights and launching complementary ventures. Expect a surge of investors gravitating towards this newly promising market. We've heard directly from insiders at DAC companies, and the sentiment is clear: before the entry of fossil industry heavyweights, challenges like funding shortages and unresponsive vendors were daunting. Now, there's a palpable shift in momentum, with better connections, ample funding, and access to significant resources. Worst thing In case you need a soundtrack for this section: Oxy’s mission statement: Net Zero Oil Vicki Hollub, Oxy's CEO Oxy plans to continue its oil & gas business and the connected emissions, and their CEO has been candid about it. Vicki Hollub, Oxy's CEO, remarked, “Thanks to Direct Air Capture, we don’t need to ever stop oil,” suggesting that the technology offers the industry “a license to operate for…60, 70, 80 years…”. For a deeper dive into Oxy's perspective, . Some key takeaways from the interview include: “Back in 2011, as the general manager of our Permian EOR operations, we assessed our oil and gas assets in the Permian Basin and realized we lacked sufficient CO2 to fully harness our resources.” Their long-term solution? DAC. “Our goal is to produce net-zero oil by injecting CO2 into our oil reservoirs globally, starting in the Permian. The process involves injecting more CO2 to extract the oil than the emissions the oil would produce when consumed. That's the essence of our net-zero carbon approach.” “Our objective is to prolong oil production as it's a potent energy source. It's essential for the world, making it a better place.” For Oxy, boasting a market cap of $56 billion, the $1 billion investment in DAC is a drop in the bucket, accounting for less than 2% of their business. Yet, it might just be the most impactful PR move they've ever executed. Oxy is not Orsted, the good ex-Oil company Despite the investment, there's no indication from Oxy about divesting from fossil fuels like Orsted did. Rather, they appear to be reinforcing their vision of Net Zero Oil. When questioned about Oxy's projected revenue in 2050, the response was clear: “If our plan works the way that we'd like for it to, our revenues from our capture of carbon for ourselves and others would equal the oil and gas revenues. And that's understanding that we don't intend to reduce our oil and gas as some are. We intend to develop our oil and gas so that it helps to match demand. A nd we believe that using CO2 for enhanced oil recovery, and generating the net-zero barrels is the way to be the last company standing in terms of who's going to produce the last barrel in the world. ” Get out of jail free card for every fossil giant This move potentially hands other oil behemoths a convenient loophole: employ DAC technology and continue extracting more oil unchecked. Missed learnings: If CE gets absorbed by Oxy and nothing happens Should Oxy fully integrate Carbon Engineering, it could disrupt the essential iterative learning process in DAC that's currently crucial. As highlighted in How Solar Got Cheap , scaling technologies like DAC requires a diverse global ecosystem with robust competition to drive innovation and efficiency. Deal was sponsored by the US government Adding another layer of complexity, the U.S. government played a role in bankrolling this deal. Oxy recently pocketed half of the U.S. government's $1.2 billion carbon capture fund, which they promptly used to acquire Carbon Engineering. This raises eyebrows, especially when the Secretary of Energy, Jennifer Granholm, has just earmarked a whopping $12 billion for direct air capture projects. This allocation is part of an even grander $35 billion commitment. Given these circumstances, it's hard not to view this as the U.S. government's indirect bolstering of the fossil fuel sector, potentially at the expense of genuine green initiatives. Public sentiment and reactions Let's tap into the public pulse. We'll kick off with those who view this move as the worst: Jonathan Foley, renowned for Project Drawdown, wrote critiquing the Biden administration's backing of industrial carbon capture projects. He contends that such initiatives mainly line the pockets of big oil firms, giving them a veneer of eco-responsibility. In essence, it enables them to continue their polluting ways, all while masquerading as champions of the environment. He summarizes it well in this : Next in line is James Temple, the Senior Climate & Energy Editor at MIT Technology Review. He shared his insights in the Rounding out our list is David Ho, a climate scientist and professor in Hawaii, ignited a flurry of memes and critical perspectives. Unearthing positive public opinions on this acquisition has been challenging, given the dominance of the greenwashing narrative. However, there are three perspectives worth spotlighting: Torben Schreiter, Climate VC, underscores this as a for the entire Climate Tech industry, warranting celebration. Dan Miller, a fellow VC, spots a : Joe Rigodanzo, writing on on carbon capture, provides a comprehensive breakdown. He enumerates five compelling reasons celebrating the move, ranging from Financial implications and Partnerships to Permitting, Expertise, and Ambition. Dive into his One can't help but wonder: What would the climate tech landscape look like had this deal not materialized? While we can speculate, the reality is that the deal has been sealed, and its true impact remains to be seen. What's clear is that the intersection of traditional fossil fuel giants and emerging climate tech startups is a complex terrain. While the infusion of capital and expertise from established players can accelerate the growth and impact of green technologies, it's crucial to ensure that these collaborations prioritize genuine environmental progress over mere optics. At Climate Drift, we're leaning into an optimistic market outlook: We believe Oxy's involvement will catalyze Carbon Engineering's scaling efforts. As the demand for DAC begins to overshadow that for oil, we're hopeful that Oxy might emulate Ørsted's transformation, evolving into a leading DAC proponent. Should Carbon Engineering's momentum stop post-acquisition, it's motivating to remember that they aren't the sole players in this field.

Climate Drift,Why Carbon Engineering's $1 Billion Acquisition is the Best & the Worst for Climate Tech,Part 1: Understanding CDR & the Players,"Why Carbon Engineering’s $1 Billion Acquisition is the Best & the Worst for Climate Tech Part 1: Understanding CDR & the Players Removing Carbon For us to have any chance to align with our climate objectives, we must swiftly reduce emissions and simultaneously fast track carbon dioxide removal. At least, that’s what the IPCC says. Here is the different carbon removal methods as outlined by the IPCC While there are numerous methods for CO2 extraction, ranging from natural to technological, the scalability of natural solutions is limited. For instance, there's a cap on how many trees we can plant, especially when our forests burn like… parched wood. So this explains why technological carbon removal, called Direct Air Capture, is currently on By 2030, we need to scale up technological carbon removal to approximately 75 MtCO2 (Megatonnes of Carbon Dioxide - so 75 Million tonnes) annually, and by 2050, this should reach 4,500 MtCO2 per year. Currently, we are at 0.01 MtCO2/year globally. Of course, this is in addition to all the other solutions, such as renewables and transportation, that we need to successfully implement by 2050. 24 nations are contemplating the integration of technological carbon removal strategies to achieve their overarching climate ambitions and 27 DAC plants have been commissioned to date worldwide. What is CDR? Direct Air Capture (DAC) technologies can extract CO2 from the atmosphere regardless of location, setting them apart from traditional carbon capture methods that typically occur at emission sources like steel plants. The captured CO2 then either needs to be securely stored in deep geological formations or repurposed for various applications. Why is it hard? Extracting CO2 directly from the atmosphere is notably costlier than other carbon capture methods. The reason being, atmospheric CO2 is far more dispersed compared to concentrated sources like emissions from power stations or cement plants. This dilution results in DAC requiring more energy and incurring higher costs. Companies like Carbon Engineering, along with their competitors, are ambitiously aiming to reduce the cost of capturing a ton of CO2 from the current range of $500-$1000 to approximately $100 (or even less) over the next 5-10 years. Where do we stand? IPCC targets in a nice graph in the State of Climate Action, one of Speed is picking up: Public and private entities are investing, and we are building our first facilities. But we are nearly not fast enough. Breakdown of some of the milestones in CDR in the the last years, again from For a deeper diver into CDR check out the (also gorgeously designed) CDR primer: What is the endgame? In the end DAC will probably not be a 'winner-takes-all' market; multiple major DAC players will gain a foothold. However, as described in , there's a clear feedback loop between scale and cost. The first company or technology that demonstrates they're within this loop is likely to attract a disproportionate amount of funding, drawing both investors and customers. Another thing one needs to understand for this acquisition: To Prime or not to prime In the aerospace and defense sectors, the term ""prime contractor"" (or ""prime"") denotes companies specializing in project-based tasks, for example designing and building fighter jets. Unlike sub-contractors, primes oversee entire projects, they are the main contractor, subcontracting smaller components. Their existence outlasts individual projects. Drawing parallels with DAC, , another DAC player, based in europe, aspires to be a prime, while Carbon Engineering opts to be a sub-contractor, specializing in the DAC technology, partnering with firms like Oxy. This Prime or not to prime decision influences risk, reward, skill allocation, control, and scalability. For instance, primes like Climeworks retain decision-making control, while Carbon Engineering's licensing approach expedites scalability. For a comprehensive analysis and in-depth exploration of the ""Prime or not"" decision, Let’s now look at the players: Elders first, so we will start with 114 year old Oxy. Oxy Occidental Petroleum Corporation, commonly referred to as Oxy due to its ticker symbol and logo, is an American hydrocarbon exploration and petrochemical manufacturing company. Founded in June 1909, so 114 years old this year, it has its headquarters in Houston and operates primarily in the U.S. (around 80% of its production) and Middle East (20%, being the largest independent oil producer in Oman). Warren Buffett’s investment firm Berkshire Hathaway has amassed Oxy stock worth an estimated $13 billion, or a 24.9% stake. It holds multiple top positions: In 2021, it ranked 183rd on the Fortune 500 based on 2020 revenues and 670th on Forbes Global 2000. In 2017, it was listed 55th on the Carbon Majors Report, highlighting top greenhouse gas emitters from 1988-2015. Oxy is no stranger to large scale acquisitions: In 2019 Oxy acquired Anadarko Petroleum for $57 billion, marking the fourth-largest oil and gas acquisition globally. With over a century of expertise, Oxy excels in chemical engineering. Its ambition is to establish a carbon capture division targeting ~$2B in annual revenue by the early 2030s. Enter: 100 years younger and America’s leading DAC company, Carbon Engineering. Carbon Engineering Established in 2009 in Canada, the company secured $110 million in funding from a mix of government entities, sustainability-centric agencies, and private investors. Notable backers include Microsoft founder Bill Gates, VCs like Lowercarbon Capital & First Round Capital. It also saw significant investments from fossil fuel giants such as Oxy, Chevron Corporation, BHP and oil sands financier Murray Edwards. Carbon Engineering employs a . This system utilizes potassium and calcium molecules to initiate a looping reaction that isolates CO2 from the air. While capturing CO2 is straightforward, extracting it from the capturing agent is energy-intensive, accounting for 80% or more of the system's total energy consumption. The primary energy source is heat, making geothermal and natural gas (which Oxy produces) more viable than solar or wind. The captured CO2 can be stored, used for enhanced oil recovery, or converted into low-carbon synthetic fuels. They've operated a pilot plant in Squamish, British Columbia since 2015, , producing fuels from captured CO2 since December 2017. A 2018 study based on pilot plant data suggests that their CO2 capture costs range from $94 to $233 per ton. Both DAC and ""air to fuel"" technologies have been validated at the pilot level and are transitioning to commercial scales. A single Carbon Engineering DAC facility could capture up to 1 million tons of CO2 annually, offsetting emissions from approximately 250,000 cars. So how did Oxy come into play? Working together: In May 2019, Carbon Engineering announced it was partnering with Oxy Low Carbon Ventures (OLCV), a subsidiary of Oxy and investor in Carbon Engineering, to design and engineer a large-scale DAC plant capable of capturing 500,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide from the air each year, which would be used in OLCV's enhanced oil recovery operations and subsequently stored underground permanently. Located in the in Texas, construction for the plant began in 2022, with operations targeted for 2024. In September 2019, Carbon Engineering announced they were expanding the capacity of the design of the plant from 500,000 metric tons to an expected 1 million metric tons of CO2 captured per year. Fast forward to August 2023: It was announced Occidental Petroleum had acquired all the outstanding equity of Carbon Engineering for $1.1 billion. With a solid grasp on CDR and a closer look at our main actors one thing is clear: The partnership between these two entities, one a century-old fossil giant and the other a pioneering player in Direct Air Capture, signifies a potential paradigm shift in how we approach both carbon removal and climate solutions.

Welcome back to Climate Drift's exploration into the world of transportation technologies along the hype curve - The last part, Part 3, early innovations and peak hype solutions. This is the third installment in our trilogy exploring the hype curve of transportation solutions. Want to dive in deeper? Start with our Part 1: Part 2: Our exploration includes, as in Part 1 & 2, with: An overview of each solution One lighthouse company per solution Today's solutions range from electric ships, trucks, and planes to alternative shipping fuels. Let’s dive in 🌊 Climate Hype Curve: Transportation - Part 3 Trucks - Carbon Capture Overview : Every year, the U.S. produces 6.6 billion metric tons of CO2e emissions. A significant 33% of this comes from transportation. Delving deeper, medium and heavy-duty trucks contribute 23% to this transportation segment. This translates to a staggering 450 million metric tons of GHGs, which is 6.8% of the U.S.'s total annual emissions. This is all from the 2 million semi-trucks that traverse our nation. Imagine the impact if we could retrofit these trucks with devices to capture these emissions - and the next solution will replace them with eTrucks. Lighthouse Company: Remora is pioneering a solution to this challenge. Their innovative device is strategically placed between the truck's cab and trailer. During refueling stops, trucks can swiftly release the captured emissions, which can then either be sold or safely stored underground. When compared to other available solutions, Remora's method stands out as a cost-effective way to reduce emissions from existing fleets. However, it's worth noting that the device captures 80% of the emissions from each truck, so while it significantly reduces emissions, it doesn't completely eliminate them. Electric Trucks Overview :  Although EVs, as detailed in Part 1, are becoming mainstream and EV buses are scaling up, e-trucks remain a rarity on the roads. Electrification is becoming an increasingly viable option for heavy-duty, long-haul trucks, even if it's not yet the most economical choice. While China leads in electric bus and truck sales, Europe is steadily gaining ground. As battery technology advances, even the most robust ground transport vehicles could benefit from electrification. Notably, most US trucks, including the largest ones, typically operate within a range of less than 200 miles, making them potential candidates for electrification. Checkout on why e-trucks are the inevitable future of transportation. In the US, the introduction of $3/kg hydrogen through the IRA could be a game-changer. If these rates persist and the cost of clean hydrogen decreases, hydrogen might become a more attractive option for certain heavy-duty vehicles. Lighthouse Company: While many truck companies prioritize big rigs, the potential of mid-sized vehicles, like FedEx delivery vans, is significant. Medium-duty vehicles, with their short ranges, consistent routes, and potential for slow, overnight charging, are ideal candidates for electrification. Harbinger Motors has innovatively designed an electric vehicle chassis that's cost-effective and functional, rivaling traditional ICE and other EV models. They specialize in creating class 4-7 commercial electric vehicle chassis, which they sell to OEMs for final vehicle production. featuring a seamlessly integrated battery and electric powertrain system. Essentially, they've taken Auke's blueprint and catapulted a decade ahead. Maritime: Alternative Fuels Overview : Fuels account for over half of shipping costs. Decarbonized fuels, being pricier than even very low sulfur fuel oil (VLSFO) and LNG from fossil sources, present an economic challenge for shipowners considering a switch to net-zero fuels. We have four primary options for net zero carbon trans-ocean shipping: Ammonia Strength : Doesn't require or emit CO2; likely the most cost-effective zero-carbon option. Weakness : Clean ammonia and ammonia-ready propulsion aren't available yet. Question : Could its toxicity hinder social acceptance? Methanol Strength : Dual-fuel engines are currently available, providing flexibility. Weakness : Depends on direct air capture (DAC) for genuine net-zero carbon production. Main Question : What will be the cost trends for clean H2 and DAC at scale? e-HFO (heavy fuel oil) Strength : Ready to use. Weaknesses : Relies on DAC for true net-zero carbon production. Likely the priciest net-zero fuel option. Main Question : How will its cost compare to methanol or ammonia? Biofuels Strength : Available now. Weaknesses : Limited feedstock availability & High costs and environmental concerns with most feedstocks. Main Question : What will be the land use impacts and limitations? Shipping giant Maersk is heavily investing in methanol for the short term and has long-term plans for ammonia. Green ammonia initiatives are emerging, leveraging the potential of cost-effective green hydrogen. By 2035, there's an expected availability of 63 million metric tons of green ammonia. Notably, ammonia is about 50% more energy-dense than liquid hydrogen and offers storage at elevated temperatures. Lighthouse Company: Amogy has pioneered a modular ammonia cracking method to produce hydrogen apt for fuel cell propulsion. They've integrated this with a third-party fuel cell.It's about 50% more energy-dense than liquid hydrogen and allows for storage at elevated temperatures. Amogy merges ammonia's logistical and cost benefits with the clean propulsion of hydrogen fuel cells. While major manufacturers won't have ammonia combustion engines until 2024, Amogy is advancing quickly with its technology. Electric Planes Overview: To cut to the chase: Electrification seems viable mainly for smaller crafts. The primary hurdle for electric aviation is battery weight, though trimming the plane's overall weight could also be a game-changer. Heart Aerospace's journey underscores the challenges of pioneering in electric aviation. They shifted from an initial vision of a fully electric 19-seater regional jet to a partially electric 30-seater. Lighthouse Company: Where's the sweet spot for electric planes right now? Regent shines by tapping into the 'wing-in-ground' effect, effectively doubling energy efficiency and setting the stage for longer electric flights. Their cutting-edge design zeroes in on low-altitude electric crafts for coastal cargo, transitioning from manual to autonomous operations. With current batteries, they can cover routes up to 180 miles, and with next-gen batteries, they aim for 500 miles, all utilizing existing dock facilities. So far, they've marked 467 seagliders sold, supported by a solid $7.9B order backlog from worldwide aviation and ferry partners. Airport Electrification Overview: In a nutshell: Electrifying planes means airports will need significantly more electricity. How significant? Basic airport electrification, like powering stationary planes at gates and charging rental cars, could increase peak load at a typical airport by over five times. Yet, this pales in comparison to the demands of even partial aviation electrification. Aircraft operations account for 55% of total airport emissions, making them the primary CO2 culprits. To break it down: An average 100-gate airport currently has a peak load of less than 10MW. Add gate electrification, and you're looking at an additional 10MW. Factor in rental car electrification, and that's another 30MW. Lighthouse Company: Smart Airport Systems (SAS) offers innovative technology solutions for airlines and airports, aiming to cut fuel consumption, emissions, and noise. Among SAS's offerings are units for electrical power and air-conditioning, termed 'APU off'. These units present a sustainable alternative to the traditional use of an aircraft's auxiliary power unit (APU) during pre-flight, boarding, and maintenance phases. Additionally, SAS introduces TaxiBot, a more sustainable way to navigate the plane on the ground. Controlled by the pilot while aircraft engines are off, using this vehicle can reduce fuel consumption during taxi up to 85%, reduce CO2 and other emissions during taxiing up to 85%, and diminish noise by up to 60%. Hydrogen Trucks Overview : While hydrogen cars and buses are gaining traction, trucks pose a different set of challenges. The IRA provides a significant advantage for hydrogen, offering subsidies that are over four times the cost of energy from wind or solar. However, to fuel a typical truck stop with green hydrogen, a solar array spanning about 2,000 acres would be required. This makes it rare to find scenarios where hydrogen can be supplied without extensive new pipeline infrastructure (very expensive). My take: eTrucks will emerge as the more cost-effective solution for trucking. This is unless the costs for electrification surge and every aspect of the hydrogen value chain aligns seamlessly Lighthouse Company: Hydra provides fleet operators a comprehensive, low-risk method to transition heavy-duty truck fleets to hydrogen use. Hydra covers the costs of vehicle retrofits using its unique engine solution, sets up refueling stations, and supplies hydrogen. Operators, in return, enter a long-term fuel agreement with Hydra, enjoying the service with minimal initial costs. Hydra aims to eventually upgrade to more advanced hydrogen engines or fuel cells and is set to launch its first hydrogen transportation corridor in British Columbia by 2024. Electric Ships Overview: Electrification is making waves in short-range maritime transport, evidenced by an increasing number of hybrid electric vessels and some fully electric ferries. Currently, the world's largest all-electric ship can transport around 200 cars for a 6-mile river journey. Ambitious plans for fully electric cargo ships aim to carry approximately 2000 containers across 600 oceanic miles. Lighthouse Company: Fleetzero aims to revolutionize marine transport with fully electric container ships, using swappable containerized batteries. Each container holds 2 MWh, and a 500 ft ship would need 30-50 containers for a 500-700 mile voyage. They propose coastal port-hopping for trans-oceanic journeys. While this approach offers a promising alternative to traditional fuel methods, it demands significant port infrastructure investments. Additionally, altering standard shipping routes could affect costs and delivery times. Port Electrification Overview: Ports and airports are poised for a significant electrification revolution. This transformation will encompass stationary vehicles, cargo equipment, rental vehicles, and short-haul cargo trucks. To grasp the magnitude of this change, consider this: a fully electrified port could rival the energy demand of a mid-sized city Lighthouse Case: The Port of Long Beach, in 2011, launched a decade-long electrification project for its cargo equipment and shore power at its vast container terminal. Over four years, the local utility, SCE, set up essential electrical infrastructure, including a new 66 transmission line and four substations. The next six years focused on electrifying various cranes: 18 ship-to-shore cranes, 5 intermodal cranes, and 70 yard gantry cranes. Remarkably, this effort covered just one of seven terminals at the port, which neighbors the Port of Los Angeles with its eight terminals. Electrifying only the port's medium-haul trucks would boost Los Angeles's energy demand by 25%. This was the last part of our 3 part series on the Hype Curve of Transportation solutions. U.S. trucks, responsible for 23% of transportation emissions, are seeing innovations like Remora's carbon capture device. While electric trucks are emerging, maritime solutions like ammonia and methanol are being adopted by giants like Maersk. Electric aviation is viable for smaller crafts, and significant electrification efforts are underway at ports and airports. Want to reread the whole series? .

Welcome back to Climate Drift's exploration into the world of transportation technologies along the hype curve. For a clear grasp of the Hype Curve, read our deep dive here: Today, we're venturing into the trough of disillusionment, where promising innovations face their toughest challenges. It's a phase where the initial excitement has waned, and the real-world challenges emerge. But remember, it's often in this very trough that true resilience is tested and innovations evolve to meet their potential. Our exploration includes, as in Part 1, with: An overview of each solution One lighthouse company per solution For Part 1: Today’s five solutions span from Battery Recycling to Alternative Airplane Fuels. Let’s dive in 🌊 Climate Hype Curve: Transportation - Part 2 Battery Recycling Overview: By 2030, global gigafactories are set to churn out over 5 TWh of battery capacity annually, with 100 million EV batteries heading for retirement within a decade. A very pressing concern is the lithium-based battery industry's fragile supply chain. Key ingredients like lithium, nickel, and cobalt are not only scarce but also concentrated in a handful of nations. Current lithium mining in South America is unsustainable, while the cobalt sector in Congo faces ethical dilemmas. Add to this, China's dominance in refining these materials, and the geopolitical stakes are high. By 2030, retired batteries could be worth over $20 billion, potentially supplying 10% of the metals for new li-ion batteries. Technological strides and government-backed research are boosting recycling, the EU mandates automakers to reclaim used batteries and sets recycling targets. The US Inflation Reduction Act 2022 offers tax breaks for recycled battery materials. VW, GM, and others are partnering with recycling firms in the U.S. to ensure ethical and green sourcing. Recycled materials not only have a lower carbon footprint but also sidestep the issues of conflict zones and child labor. The current scarcity of old batteries is a major obstacle in replicating the . The solution? Utilize battery scrap from new battery production. Lighthouse Company: Li-Cycle: Boasting a state-of-the-art facility, Li-Cycle stands as one of North America's premier li-ion battery recycler. They've pioneered a unique hydrometallurgical method, achieving over 95% material recovery. The company is expanding with multiple facilities throughout North America, designed to process all types of batteries into ""black mass"" without discharging. This mass is then sent to a central hub for further recovery. Li-Cycle either sells the recovered materials or returns them to battery suppliers through a mutual contract. EV Charging network Overview: With the surge in the EV market, efficient charging infrastructure is crucial. While most EV charging currently happens at homes and workplaces, the rise in public fast chargers is transforming this. These chargers, which address the 'range anxiety' of potential EV users, are not only enabling longer trips but also enticing those without private charging to consider EVs. We possess the technology; it's time for deployment. However, we've know that charging, being a commodity, is costly, leading to several  of the major charging network companies being in trouble. As of 2023, there are currently more than 160,000 EV chargers in the United States, led by California. Yet, the majority are Level 2 chargers, with only 16% being fast-charging Level 3. In 2021, global public chargers grew by 37%, reaching 1.8 million. China, holding 85% of the world's fast chargers, is at the forefront yet again, followed by Europe, with the Netherlands leading in slow chargers. China's fast charger installations saw a 50% rise in 2021, backed by government initiatives. Meanwhile, the U.S. and Europe continue to expand their networks, with Tesla superchargers comprising 60% of U.S. fast chargers. Lighthouse Company: EV charging already costs less than filling a gas tank. But it can be even cheaper: Free. Volta has established a vast network of EV charging stations located in parking areas near grocery stores, pharmacies, banks, and hospitals. These charging services are free for EV users, thanks to ads of retailers and brands aiming to target the EV demographic. Currently, over 3,000 Volta charging stations are spread across 31 states, predominantly situated in major city venues like shopping centers, stadiums, theme parks, and hospitals. Following its 2023 acquisition by Shell, the company anticipates a significant expansion in its charging stations. Hydrogen Cars & Buses Overview: Fuel cell vehicles are essentially non-existent on a graph, nearing zero. As of 2023, only two hydrogen car models, Toyota Mirai and Hyundai Nexo, are available in specific markets. Hydrogen buses also exist, but in 2022, Montpellier, France, found hydrogen buses to be six times costlier to operate than electric ones. A 2017 analysis highlighted hydrogen vehicles' inefficiencies and high costs, suggesting they might remain a niche technology. By 2020, hydrogen vehicles were only 38% efficient compared to 80%-95% for battery EVs. Globally, 5,648 hydrogen buses operated in 2020, with 93.7% in China. However, there's potential. Some manufacturers use hydrogen fuel cells to extend the range of battery electric buses. For instance, the Mercedes-Benz eCitaro's range increases from 280 km to 400 km with a Toyota fuel cell. In 2020, Nanning, China, aimed to replace 7,000 electric buses with hydrogen hybrids. By May 2022, Cologne, Germany ordered 100 hydrogen buses, aligning with Germany's 'National Hydrogen Strategy' that sees hydrogen buses as viable for long routes. Lighthouse Company: Daimler:  Mercedes-Benz also plans to offer an eCitaro bus with a Toyota hydrogen range extender. Starting in 2025, Daimler Buses is set to roll out its first fully electric inter-city bus, with hydrogen-fueled coaches following by the decade's end. Embracing the dual-track strategy of its parent, Daimler Truck, the company is diving into both battery-electric and hydrogen-driven tech. They believe this dual approach is essential to cater to the varied requirements of their clientele. Ship Improvements Overview: Ships account for over 18% of nitrogen oxides pollution and 3% of greenhouse gas emissions. Despite their efficiency in transporting cargo, their vast numbers impact the environment. Here's how we can enhance ships for better performance: Engine Upgrades: Upgrading propulsion systems, like using LNG or electric systems, can cut fuel use and emissions. Modifying existing engines, like adding turbochargers or waste heat recovery, also boosts efficiency. Operational Tweaks: Slower vessel speeds, optimal route selection, and reduced port time can enhance fuel efficiency. Digital tools, like voyage optimization software, can guide operators to the most efficient routes. Data-Driven Fuel Management: Analyzing fuel usage data can spotlight areas for improvement, from maintenance needs to operational habits. Continuous measurement provides a comprehensive view of consumption factors, guiding efficiency efforts. Lighthouse Company: Sails are not only cool but also effective in reducing emissions by 20%. And guess what? Flying sails, like kites, take the cool factor up a notch. Airseas, established in 2016, taps into aeronautics know-how to bring groundbreaking ship propulsion tech to the table. They're prepping to unveil a Seawing production hub in 2026 and are beefing up their industrial sector. With plans to hire 70 more talents by 2023, they're set to grow their crew to 190, all ready for the Seawing production surge. Wind-driven sails are the future, especially with the mission to cut CO2 footprints by 40% come 2030. Big players, like “K” Line, are already sailing with Airseas, aiming to equip 50 ships with Seawing in a two-decade partnership. Planes: Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Overview: For most sea and air vehicles (and some large land ones), electricity might not cut it. In such cases, biofuels and hydrogen-upgraded fuels seem promising. Biofuels are currently the leading sustainable, commercial fuel, with the US trading 19B gallons in 2021. However, they face challenges like limited feedstock availability and varying carbon impacts. For instance, some biofuels can emit more carbon than fossil fuels. The competition for biomass resources, like land, will also intensify, especially as global warming affects agricultural yields. Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) are the top bet for decarbonizing aviation by 2050. With the global narrowbody fleet worth $1.4 trillion, drop-in biofuels and e-kerosene are the go-to for the existing fleet. Airlines are on board, even agreeing to pay thrice the price for greener fuels. In 2020, the SAF market stood at $72.1 million and is projected to skyrocket to $6.26 billion by 2030. A great breakdown of the SAF market by my friend Christoph Bernkopf can be found Lighthouse company: Metafuel is on a mission to revolutionize green jet fuel production using innovative processes centered around green methanol. This fuel seamlessly integrates with current sustainable aviation fuel blends. What sets Metafuel apart is its efficiency and precision in targeting desired fuel molecules, minimizing low-value byproducts. Navigating the trough of disillusionment is no easy feat. It's a phase marked by skepticism, challenges, and a need for perseverance. But history has shown that many technologies that wade through this phase come out stronger, more refined, and ready to make a lasting impact. At Climate Drift, we remain hopeful and excited about the future of these innovations. Join us as we continue to track their journey, from the trough to the slopes of enlightenment.

Pass the knowledge on to a friend, relative, or that cool stranger you just met: Hey there! 👋 Skander here. Today is the first part of us going to dive into the current hype curve of transportation. Transportation isn't just about moving from point A to B; it's the backbone of our society, connecting us to education, jobs, goods, and services. Each transportation solution we touch upon truly merits a thorough deep dive (or its own dedicated team researching it). However, today we'll begin with a bird's-eye view, spotlighting some of the most intriguing solutions on the hype curve. We will explore: A quick overview for each solution One lighthouse company per solution This is the first installment in our trilogy exploring the hype curve of transportation solutions. Want to have the full overview? Start with our Part 1: Part 2: Part 3: Beginning on the right, today we are looking at five solutions, from EVs to Rail, spanning the plateau of productivity (primed and aggressively scaling) and the Slope of Enlightenment (those initiating their scaling journey). Let’s dive in 🌊 Climate Solutions Hype - Transportation Part 1 Let’s start by quantifying the emissions coming from transportation. Road vehicles were the leading culprits, accounting for an estimated 72% of transportation emissions. Maritime shipping trailed at 12%, while aviation contributed 9%. Rail and other sources combined made up the remaining 7%. 3 transportation shifts that will need to happen Our carbon trajectory is largely tethered to our transportation choices, and to change our course, three monumental shifts must take root. 1. Reimagining Movement At the heart of sustainable transportation lies a return to basics: human-powered movement. It's essential that our core methods of moving – walking and cycling – not only remain pivotal, but become central once more. This, coupled with a greater reliance on communal transport systems, will be crucial. 2. The End of the Internal Combustion Age Here government intervention is pivotal. The age of the internal combustion engine – with its carbon footprint – is set to pass into history. The mandate is clear: a full migration to zero-emission vehicles. And here's a silver lining: approximately 50% of cars sold globally were under jurisdictions that had either set an electric vehicle goal or prohibited the sale of ICE vehicles. 3. Moving stuff towards Net Zero Our global conveyance systems, both over oceans and in the skies, cannot be left behind in this metamorphosis. The dual strategy is to simultaneously dampen demand where possible and to usher in state-of-the-art zero-carbon tech. Every ship that sails and every plane that soars needs to be a part of this green transition.

Now, let's plot our top picks on a hype curve and dive in. 2 Wheelers: Electric two/three-wheeler sales share by region, 2015-2021 by IEA Overview: Two and three-wheelers are at the forefront of electrification, especially in developing countries where they often outnumber cars. Notably, in many Asian regions, they're the primary mode of transportation. In 2022, India saw over half of its three-wheeler registrations go electric, driven by government incentives and their cost-effectiveness against the backdrop of surging fuel prices. Plus, half of China's two/three-wheeler sales are now electric. The takeaway? , and the next step is increasing production to replace all traditional ICE two-wheelers on the road. Lighthouse Company: Gogoro, hailing from Taiwan, has pioneered a groundbreaking battery-swapping infrastructure tailored for urban electric two-wheelers, encompassing scooters, mopeds, and motorcycles. Beyond crafting its signature line of electric scooters, Gogoro collaborates with leading vehicle manufacturers such as Hero (the global leader in two-wheeled vehicles), Yamaha, Aeonmotor, PGO, eReady, and eMOVING. It also operates and partners with ridesharing services. EVs: IEA Electric car sales - guess which countries are which color. Resolution here: https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/electric-car-sales-2016-2023 Overview: 2022 was a landmark year for the electric car industry, with global sales skyrocketing past 10 million. This means that 14% of all new cars sold in 2022 were electric, a significant increase from 9% in 2021 and a mere 5% in 2020. China continued to dominate, accounting for a whopping 60% of worldwide sales. In fact, over half of all electric cars globally are now cruising China's roads, and the nation has surpassed its 2025 new energy vehicle sales target. Europe, the second-largest market, witnessed a 15% surge in electric car sales, signifying that one in every five cars sold was electric. Meanwhile, the U.S., ranking third, saw its electric car sales grow by an impressive 55%, achieving an 8% share of total sales. On the financial front, a massive $425 billion was invested in electric cars globally in 2022, marking a 50% increase from 2021. Interestingly, only 10% of this expenditure was backed by government support, with the lion's share coming directly from consumers. Hannah Ritchie provides a compelling analysis on why the growth trajectory of EVs is tracking the success case of solar. . Lighthouse Company : BYD Co. Ltd., based in Shenzhen, China, is a leading conglomerate specializing in electric and hybrid vehicles, battery-powered bicycles, solar panels, and rechargeable batteries. In June 2022, BYD Auto outpaced Tesla, becoming the world's top electric vehicle manufacturer with sales of 641,000 EVs in the first half. By year-end, it was the first to sell over a million NEVs globally. In 2021, BYD held 9.1% and 7% global market shares for plug-in electric vehicles and BEVs, respectively. Primarily selling in China, BYD is rapidly expanding globally, targeting 1.5 to 2 million plug-in EV sales in 2022. Fleet Electrification: Overview: The worldwide automotive industry is primarily driven by the demand for passenger vehicles, which significantly overshadow other categories. Heavy- and medium-duty vehicles, for instance, make up a mere 5% of the overall vehicle inventory. Interestingly, while the majority of vehicles on the road are privately owned passenger cars, light commercial vehicles stand out as they are chiefly owned by businesses and enterprises. Lighthouse Companies: Since the major players control two-thirds of the commercial vehicle market, let's delve into their goals: - Amazon: Last goal: 10,000 electrified trucks from Rivian by 2022, reached 5,000, next goal: 100,000 by 2030 - Fedex: 50% of fleet electric by 2022, 100,000 100% by 2040 - DHL: 70% of fleet clean by 2025, 50% of fleet electric by 2022, zero-emissions by 2050 Electric Buses Overview: The electric bus revolution is sweeping across the globe, with urban public transport fleets leading the charge. By 2019, Mainland China was home to 99% of the world's electric buses, a staggering 421,000 vehicles, or 17% of its total bus fleet. For context, the U.S. had only 300 out of its 75,000 municipal buses, and Europe, 2,250. By 2021, Europe's numbers grew to 8,500, yet China's 98% global share remained unchallenged. In contrast, the U.S. saw a rise from 450 e-buses in 2019 to a promising 3,533 by 2021, marking a 27% increase. Forecasts suggest that by 2040, electric buses will make up an impressive 67% of the worldwide bus fleet. Lighthouse Company: Electric school buses are gaining traction in the U.S., bolstered by billions in federal and state grants. Highland is at the forefront of this shift, aiming to make electric fleets both accessible and affordable. They provide electric school buses, charging infrastructure, cover electricity and maintenance costs, and manage the intricacies of electrification. Clients pay a subscription fee, designed to be more economical than current diesel fleet expenses. Rail Overview: Trains are 4x more energy-efficient than trucks, but rail freight is declining while trucking grows, influenced by the e-commerce surge and reduced coal demand. Despite rail's efficiency, its primary use in the U.S. is for bulk resources like coal and lumber, with only a small portion dedicated to intermodal transport, which shifts containers between ships, trucks, and trains. As rail's potential for electrification is evident, Europe is also exploring hydrogen as an alternative. Lighthouse Company: The genuine solution lies in recognizing that rail is already a carbon-efficient option. Our primary focus should be transitioning freight from trucks to trains. If you are still looking for an innovative company: Parallel Systems is innovating in the rail transport sector by crafting a modular, autonomous, electric railcar tailored for agile fleet deployments. Their primary focus is ""intermodal"" rail transport, essentially emphasizing container-based cargo freight. This new rail vehicle design addresses several challenges: reducing carbon emissions in freight, alleviating supply chain bottlenecks of trucking, and overcoming the limitations of traditional railway freight. The transportation sector is undergoing a monumental shift towards sustainability. From electric two-wheelers in Asia to the rise of electric buses globally, the momentum is undeniable. As we continue to explore and innovate, it's crucial to remember the bigger picture: a world where transportation not only connects us but does so in harmony with the environment. With pioneers like Gogoro and BYD leading the charge, the future of transportation looks promising. Join us on this journey, share the knowledge, and let's drive the change together.

And if you are looking for one of the best sectors to start your climate career, a 70% YoY growth is a very clear sign that you’re looking at one of the best industries. In , we shed light on: The intricate journey of a Solar Buyer. What happens inside a resi company Outlook: Market shifts in resi Solar’s shadows: A look at industry challenges. Today, we dive even deeper: it's time to spotlight the market leaders in the US solar realm. Let’s dive in 🌊 Skander The Companies of Residential Solar: Part 1 First and foremost, it's important to grasp that the residential solar (resi again from now on) market is highly segmented. Impressively, local and regional installers handle a significant 66% of the market. What makes them so dominant? They have built reputable local businesses through: Brand trust within their communities Years in the business Solid financial standing Organic word of mouth growth Yet, many remain confined to their local regions, facing numerous challenges in expanding further: Supply Chain Issues Because of their size, they frequently find themselves at the end of the supply chain queue. Limited Expertise Due to Smaller Teams: Their teams struggle with specialized knowledge gaps, ranging from technical challenges, adapting to new technologies, to insufficient manpower for effective customer service. Expansion Hesitancy: Their lack of experience in venturing into new markets hinders expansion. These constraints can lead customers to bear higher costs while settling for substandard service. This landscape is pushing local installers to find refuge under aggregator umbrellas. These aggregators fall into two main categories: the long-established industry titans accustomed to partnering with third parties, and the rising contenders bringing fresh perspectives to the table. In the next essay we will dive into the rising contenders. Next, we'll delve into three prominent players from the traditional camp: Sunrun - largest player with 13% market share Tesla - 4th largest player with 3.7% market share Sunpower - 5th largest player with 2.7% market share The Framework of a Resi Company Essentially, each resi provider revolves around three pivotal business functions: Sales & Marketing Installation Financial Solutions You can read more about all those business functions . These functions serve as our primary lens, and most innovative approaches and unique attributes can be traced back to these areas. Sunrun Output in 2022: 990 MW solar Employees 12,408 534 jobs open HQ: SF based Public company, Nasdaq listed, S&P 400 Established 2007 Sunrun, established 16 years ago, currently stands as the market leader in the US with an impressive 13% market share. Listed on NASDAQ and a member of the S&P 400, it's a force to be reckoned with in the solar industry. In 2022, Sunrun achieved a remarkable milestone by setting up solar systems capable of producing an astonishing 990 megawatts of energy. Over its lifespan, the company has deployed an immense 5.7 gigawatts of power, serving nearly 800,000 customers. For context, in 2022 alone, around 700,000 American households adopted solar energy solutions. Sunrun's primary strategy focuses on expansion: aiming to make solar energy accessible to all and integrating it into every facet of daily life. For that they went out and expanded on 3 key areas. Direct Sales Approach: Sunrun's $3.2 billion acquisition of Vivint Solar in 2020 underscored its ambitious vision. Originating from Lehi, Utah, Vivint Solar's primary mode of operation was through direct home sales, like door-to-door campaigns. Sunrun recognized this as a valuable avenue to enhance its reach, which had earlier constraints in the direct sales segment. Financing: From its early days, Sunrun championed the power purchase agreement (PPA) model. Here, the company shoulders the responsibility of installing and overseeing a solar system at a client's residence. Following this, Sunrun then sells energy to the homeowner at a pre-determined rate, spanning either a 20 or 25-year duration. Especially good at Partnerships: Sunrun's association with prominent market players amplifies its reach and impact. Partnerships with giants like Costco and The Home Depot have enabled Sunrun to engage with potential clients within these stores. 2022 witnessed another milestone when Ford collaborated with Sunrun, appointing it as the official installation partner for bidirectional charging stations tailored for the F-150 Lightning. This facilitates not only home charging for the truck but also the utilization of the vehicle's battery as an alternative power source during grid interruptions. Sunpower 4,710 Employees HQ: Richmond California Owned by TotalEnergies Established 1985 From the labs of Stanford University to the rooftops of millions, the tale of SunPower is that of passion and innovation. In 1985, a determined electrical engineering professor from Stanford, Richard Swanson, after shattering previous records of solar efficiency, embarked on an audacious journey. He paused his academia and initiated SunPower, a venture to propel solar technology from research confines into the broader commercial realm. A key twist in this journey arrived in 2011 when the French energy titan, Total, recognizing the future of renewables, invested a whopping $1.37 billion for a majority stake in SunPower. Focus matters: Shift from Utility and resi solar to only resi During its formative years, SunPower carved a niche for itself by constructing some of the most colossal solar infrastructures in the United States. The year 2008 marked its venture into large-scale solar farm constructions, partnering with utility mammoths PG&E and OptiSolar in San Luis Obispo and Hayward. Beyond these, the company's prowess was evident in iconic projects like the one at the Kennedy Space Center. Their global footprint expanded in 2004 with the erection of the Bavaria Solarpark in Germany, a mammoth installation covering 62 acres across three distinct sites. At its inception, this German marvel held the distinguished title of the world's grandest solar facility. Sunpower built Bavaria Solarpark, largest solar facility at the time. Come 2022, the company's trajectory took a significant turn. TotalEnergies acquired the company's commercial and industrial sectors for a neat $250 million. In 2022 Sunpower also added another feather to its cap, SunPower inked a deal with global retail giant, IKEA. The collaboration aimed at offering solar solutions to the eco-conscious clientele of IKEA's California outlet. The pivot to consumer focus was complete. Technology matters SunPower stands at the forefront of solar technology, offering an array of products and services related to solar energy. This encompasses the sale, installation, and financing of components like panels, batteries, mounting systems, and relevant software. While their offerings might come with a higher price tag, they compensate by delivering unparalleled energy efficiency compared to their competitors. Given their efficiency, SunPower systems are the go-to choice for areas with space constraints, like rooftops. So the closest widely known brand comparison is Apple: a self developed, integrated ecosystem, superior performance, superior price. Tesla Energy Output in 2022: 348 MW solar 127,855 Employees (at Tesla overall) HQ: San Mateo, Bay Area Part of Tesla Established 2006 as Solar City Let’s dive into the sun-soaked story of SolarCity. Back in 2006, the Rive bros - Peter and Lyndon - took a hot tip from their cousin (you might know him: Elon Musk, Tesla’s CEO) and launched SolarCity. Elon didn’t just toss the idea to them; he chaired SolarCity too. Fast forward to 2016: SolarCity had installed solar systems for over 325,000 customers, making it the US's go-to for solar installations. But then, August 2016 rolls around, and the script flips. Tesla throws in an all-stock offer worth a whopping $2.6 billion to acquire SolarCity. Monetary Maneuvers Here's where things get intriguing. SolarCity's prime hustle was door-to-door sales of leased systems. It was the “get solar now, pay as you use” kind of deal - zero upfront costs with a 20-year contract. It became America's darling solar model, skyrocketing SolarCity as the residential solar chief. But, plot twist: by 2016, this strategy plunged the company into a debt pit over $1.5 billion deep. Tesla's decision to buy? Not exactly a slam dunk. Changing Lanes with Tesla Tesla Energy reshaped the Solar City narrative. Their mantra? ""Deliver the US's cheapest solar."" As of 2021, their rate stood at $2 per watt (pre-tax credits). They achieved this by ditching door-to-door sales, sidelining ads, and cutting down on the lease financing. But some customers weren't thrilled about slower responses and longer admin waits. Consequences? After Tesla's takeover, the solar installation numbers saw a dip. Q2 2019 hit a low of 29 megawatts. For context, pre-Tesla in Q4 2015, SolarCity was doing 253 megawatts. Compare that to Sunrun's hefty 2,013 megawatts. Analysts whispered that SolarCity was a cash drain for Tesla in 2019. But hey, things are looking up! The 2022 playbook shows solar systems with a power of 348 MW (a tad 1% bump from 2021) and a whopping 6.54 GWh in battery storage (62% up from 2021). Revenue shot up 40% to $3.91 billion. Tesla’s Secret Sauce Tesla Energy's business revamp focussed on high-margin projects, often paired with Tesla Powerwalls. The US hasn’t fully embraced the solar+battery combo (unlike Europe), but Tesla’s paving the way. Unexpected tech insight Tesla Energy doesn’t craft its solar panels. As of summer 2023, they were flashing Tesla-branded panels made by Qcells. In sum, the residential solar market in the U.S. is vibrant, dynamic, and rapidly evolving. This exploration has offered a glimpse into the market's current market leaders: Sunrun, with its rapid expansion and direct sales approach, continues to cast a long shadow across the industry. SunPower’s journey from Stanford's labs to commercial grandeur and its shift towards consumer-focused solutions have placed it firmly in the industry's limelight. Tesla Energy, riding on the allure of the Tesla brand and its visionary leader Elon Musk, tells a tale of dramatic twists, turns, and reinventions. These narratives only hint at the depth and complexity of the solar revolution. The future promises further revelations, as newer players, technologies, and business models emerge. Next time we will look at 3 of these challengers. Time to reinvent.

A single point of contact, a unified vision, and a streamlined process. As we'll explore further, the trend is clear: solar vendors are evolving, aiming to offer a holistic, full-stack experience. Behind the Solar Panels At its core, every resi provider operates around three fundamental business functions. 1. Sales and Marketing: The Frontline Warriors At the forefront of any solar provider's operations is the Sales and Marketing team. Their role? To communicate the value proposition, resonate with potential customers, and drive the narrative of sustainable energy solutions. This team is the bridge between the company's offerings and the homeowner's aspirations. Direct Salesforce: This is the in-house team, trained and equipped with deep product knowledge. They're the ones who engage directly with customers, understanding their needs, and offering tailored solutions. Dealer Network: Beyond the direct team, a solar provider often collaborates with a network of dealers. These dealers, while external, are integral in expanding the provider's reach, tapping into local markets, and offering a personalized touch. 2. Installation: Where Vision Meets Reality Once a homeowner is on board, the next crucial phase is installation. This is where the abstract concept of solar energy transforms into a tangible entity on one's rooftop. Direct Install: Some providers prefer to keep this process in-house. A dedicated team of experts handles the installation, ensuring quality, consistency, and adherence to brand standards. Dealer Network: Just as with sales, installation too can be outsourced to a trusted network of dealers. These local experts, familiar with regional nuances, can offer a seamless installation experience. 3. Financial Solutions: Making Solar Accessible Solar energy is an investment, and like any investment, it requires capital. Recognizing this, solar providers have crafted financial solutions to make this transition smoother and more accessible. Power Purchase Agreements (PPA): This is a unique model where homeowners can host solar panels without the upfront cost. Instead, they agree to purchase the power generated by these panels, often at rates lower than traditional utilities. Loans: For those looking to own the system outright, solar providers often collaborate with financial institutions to offer tailored loan solutions. This allows homeowners to spread out the cost over time, making the investment more manageable. Having delved into the anatomy of resi providers, it's clear that each segment, from proactive sales teams to the essential finance departments, plays a significant role in steering the solar industry's direction. But here's something to consider: not every company encompasses all these facets. Some choose to specialize in particular areas, honing their expertise and delivering unparalleled value in that domain. Specialization can often lead to mastery, setting a company apart in a crowded market. Outlook: Gazing into the crystal ball to predict market shifts. 3 major factors are currently changing resi companies: The Rise of the Full Stack Approach The solar industry is undergoing a transformative phase. As we've observed, there's a distinct trend emerging. More and more companies are leaning towards a 'full stack' model, aiming to offer a comprehensive suite of services all under one banner. As we journey further, we'll spotlight some of the leading 'Resi' giants in the U.S., delving into how they seamlessly weave together these core functions. The Power of Customer Relationships Shifting gears, there's an increasing emphasis on the value of customer relationships. In an industry that's becoming more fragmented, owning and nurturing these relationships is paramount. This fragmentation, while presenting challenges, also offers a silver lining for consumers: a move towards quality and trustworthiness. From Single Transactions to Lifelong Partnerships There's also a palpable shift in the business ethos. Gone are the days when solar companies would simply sell panels and then step back. The modern solar enterprise is looking at the bigger picture, focusing on long-term engagement. From introducing homeowners to the world of solar, designing bespoke setups, and installing systems, to upselling complementary products like batteries and software, and then ensuring years of reliable maintenance - it's all about enhancing the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV). This holistic approach not only benefits businesses but also ensures homeowners receive consistent value and support throughout their solar journey. Challenges in the Solar Realm It's not always bright skies; we're diving into 3 of the industry's challenges. The Complexity Conundrum The solar industry, while promising, often presents itself as a complex puzzle to the end customer. What most homeowners seek is simplicity, reliability, and top-notch service. However, the intricacies involved in adopting solar can be overwhelming. It's essential to remember that the end users, the homeowners, are the ultimate decision-makers when it comes to resi adoption. Their struggle with understanding and navigating this complexity can deter many from making the switch. Furthermore, this complexity isn't just a challenge for consumers.

More solar means cheaper solar But this is not the full story: It took 9 different Innovation Accelerators to turn solar cheap. But before diving into that, let's journey through the annals of solar history, visualized as a cookbook. The Global Solar Cookbook: Imagine a solar cookbook, where each chapter represents a nation's unique recipe and ingredients. The U.S.: Setting the appetizer course, the United States introduced the world to the flavor of modern solar potential with the Bell Labs breakthrough in 1954. Seasoned with government R&D programs in the mid-70s, the U.S. emphasized the importance of continuous research and innovation, laying the foundation for the courses to follow. Japan: As the menu progressed, Japan added its signature dish with its ""million roof program."" By incentivizing homeowners through subsidies, Japan not only fostered domestic adoption but also showcased how niche markets can enrich the culinary landscape of technological growth. Germany: Germany's signature dish is flavored by the success of the ""feed-in tariff"" program, a policy that guaranteed renewable energy producers a fixed rate for the electricity they supplied to the grid. This strategy sped up market growth and drew in new manufacturers. Australia: With a more subtle yet essential side dish, Australia trained a generation of solar entrepreneurs and engineers. Many later established manufacturing bases in China, highlighting the importance of knowledge transfer and global collaboration in this solar culinary journey. China : Culminating in a grand dessert, China's contribution is sweetened by its rapid manufacturing scale-up and entrepreneurial spirit. Driving costs down to unprecedented lows, China's recipe underscores the significance of disruptive production and the global supply chain in perfecting the solar feast. The 9 Innovation Accelerators: Let's condense these decades of insights into a versatile framework tailored for diverse climate technologies: 1. Continuous R&D: Just like a chef tirelessly perfects a signature dish, solar's evolution has been shaped by relentless R&D. Both public and private sectors have been in the kitchen, ensuring the flame under the solar pot never goes out. 2. Public Procurement: Imagine governments as gourmet food critics. When they endorse solar, it's like getting a Michelin star. The from 1975 to 1985, for instance, was like a massive order that pushed chefs to refine their cooking techniques. 3. Trained Workforce: A restaurant's success isn't just about the head chef; it's the entire kitchen brigade. As of 2023, approximately 4,000,000 people are employed in the solar industry worldwide. In the United States alone, there are 250,000 individuals employed in the solar sector. 4. Codify Knowledge: Every chef has a secret recipe book. For solar, it's the codified knowledge, ensuring that every innovation and insight is documented and shared publicly. 5. Disruptive Production: Think of this as the avant-garde cuisine of the solar world. It's not just about traditional cooking; it's about reimagining dishes in ways that surprise and delight. 6.

Global Mobility: Chefs travel, learn from global cuisines, and bring back exotic flavors. Similarly, solar experts attending global conferences ensure that the best practices are shared and adopted worldwide. 9. Political Economy: Navigating the culinary world isn't just about the food; it's about understanding the diners, the critics, and the market trends. Similarly, solar has to understand and navigate the intricate interplay of politics, society, and economics. Lessons Beyond Solar: Can We Replicate Solar's Trajectory in Other Verticals? Which technologies fit this model? It's applicable to some, but certainly not all. Type-1 Technologies: Advanced, iterative, and always evolving, they're the technologies that have the potential to revolutionize sectors. Other members of this category include offshore wind turbines, high altitude wind turbines, fuel cells, desalination, and end-use technologies. The trajectory of PV's offers a roadmap for how these technologies can be accelerated. Type-2 Technologies: Picture these as the grassroots movements of the tech landscape. They're small-scale, low-tech, but with massive potential for impact. Instead of groundbreaking technological advancements, their power lies in behavioral change and widespread adoption. Planting forests for carbon storage or tweaking agricultural practices to enhance soil carbon are prime examples. The challenge? Convincing millions to adopt these practices. It's less about inventing and more about implementing. The Green Revolution serves as an inspiration here. Type-3 Technologies: These are the skyscrapers of the tech world: massive, complex, and hard to iterate. They include behemoths like nuclear power, carbon capture at power plants, and low-carbon steel making. The primary challenge is in system integration, managing the intricate dance of numerous components, and ensuring cost-effectiveness. While the scale is vast, the opportunities for iterative learning are limited. For instance, the nuclear industry, despite its vast capacity, has built significantly fewer reactors than the number of solar panels produced. Type-4 Technologies: These are the game-changers, the technologies that have the potential to redefine sectors and even economies. They're termed General Purpose Technologies (GPTs) and have historically included innovations like the steam engine and the internet. Looking ahead, we might see artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, or synthetic biology taking up this mantle. The rapid diffusion and transformative impact of the internet serve as a beacon for how future GPTs might be integrated into our world. In Summary: Each technology type presents its own set of challenges and opportunities. While Type-1 technologies can directly benefit from the solar PV model, the others require tailored approaches. Type-2 hinges on mass adoption, Type-3 on managing complexity and scale, and Type-4 on both innovation and rapid diffusion. Thanks for diving in with us!

Be one of our trailblazing 1,000 readers by subscribing here: Subscribe Hey there 👋, It's Skander here. Ever puzzled over how solar soared or why hydrogen is struggling to find its footing? Why do some climate technologies flourish while others falter? The answer lies in a complex journey through various stages of growth, adoption, and sometimes, stagnation. Join me as we delve into the S-Curve of Technology Adoption, a concept that's now at the heart of Climate Tech. Let’s explore the highs and lows, the breakthroughs and setbacks, and the dance between innovation and constraint that shapes our path towards a cleaner future. Time to dive in. 🌊 The S-Curve Chronicle Stages of the S-Curve The adoption of new technologies rarely follows a straight line. More often, it traces a complex S-curve trajectory, shaped by various stages of growth and development. Emergence Stage: Initially, progress is slow and linear, like a budding idea trying to find its footing, often hindered by technological constraints and market uncertainties. Breakthrough Acceleration: Then, a critical breakthrough occurs, igniting exponential growth. This forms the steep incline of the S-curve, driven by innovation, acceptance, and market dynamics. Diffusion and Integration: At this stage, the technology becomes mainstream, growing linearly but at a much faster rate. It weaves into daily life, becoming a standard part of the landscape. Reconfiguration: Finally, as saturation looms, growth starts to taper, reflecting the maturation of the technology. This S-curve isn't set in stone. It can be twisted and turned by obstacles, or given a boost by supportive policies, leading to positive tipping points. A mere linear assessment won't do justice to these complex dynamics. Now, let's look at the real adoption curve of historical technologies to understand how these phases played out in practice. Origin: The S-curve is a universal phenomenon, found in numerous systems characterized by both positive feedback loops and constraints. It's a dance between two forces: Positive Feedback Loop: This drives acceleration in the curve. Imagine a snowball rolling down a hill, gathering speed and size. The momentum feeds on itself, speeding up the process until… Constraints: These act like barriers or friction, slowing down the growth. It's the obstacles in the path of the snowball that hinder its progress, temporarily halting the acceleration. The intriguing rhythm of the S-curve comes from this push and pull between acceleration and constraint. Break one constraint, and the positive feedback loop surges forward again, only to be reined in by the next constraint. This intricate interplay creates the signature S-curve, an essential concept in understanding the growth dynamics of various phenomena, including climate tech adoption. This stop-and-go pattern is expertly detailed and exemplified in the context of solar technology in the book "" "" The story of solar power’s evolution perfectly captures this dynamic interplay, where technological advancements and decreasing costs led to spurts of growth, only to be halted by various constraints such as policy regulations, infrastructure limitations, or market acceptance. For those yearning to explore the thrilling interplay of positive feedback loops and constraints further, "" "" is your next insightful read. Categories of adopters Adopters can encompass a wide array of entities, from individual enthusiasts to diverse organizations such as businesses, electricity providers, or governmental bodies. The spectrum of adopters can be broken down into the following key categories: Innovators : These are the pioneers in adopting new technologies. They often possess the highest social status within their communities, along with substantial financial liquidity, and are highly connected to scientific resources. Innovators are typically characterized by their willingness to take risks, even embracing technologies that might ultimately fail, with their financial resources providing a buffer against such failures. Early Adopters: Comprising the next 10%ish of the market, early adopters eagerly embrace the innovative product. Often referred to as “power users,” their insights significantly shape the development of the product, from the preliminary prototype to the finalized version. Early Majority: Unlike the adventurous early adopters, the first majority, encompassing the subsequent 35%ish of the market, are less technically skilled and more cautious. They keenly observe the experiments of early adopters, and once the product reaches a stable evolution (crossing the chasm), they are prepared to adopt it. Late Majority: This group is even more cautious than the first majority, holding off until there are clear indications of the product’s maturity and standardization before embracing the innovation. Laggards: Typically resistant to change, laggards may oppose the innovation due to ideological concerns or fear. Alternatively, they might reject the offering in favor of a clearly inferior solution because of competition or sunk cost bias. The product's growth kicks off when it gains traction with innovators and early adopters, leading to an accelerated adoption rate. As it begins to make inroads into the majorities, the growth curve steepens. Eventually, as market saturation is reached, the growth rate tapers off and ultimately aligns with the overall market's growth, drawing closer to an asymptotic limit So now let’s put everything together and into a climate context: Emergence: Slow Linear Growth Example : Hydrogen Fuel Cell Technology Why : Hydrogen fuel cell technology, particularly for vehicle use, is in its early stages of development with slow and steady growth. While fuel cells have significant potential to provide a clean source of power, there are several obstacles including the high cost of fuel cell production, the lack of a hydrogen distribution infrastructure, and the challenge of producing hydrogen in an environmentally friendly way. As a result, the technology's adoption has so far been limited and gradual, mostly by early adopters and certain niche sectors like public transportation in environmentally conscious cities. Breakthrough: Exponential Growth Example: Electric Vehicles (EVs) Why: The breakthrough stage for EVs occurred when advancements in battery technology, increased charging infrastructure, and favorable government policies converged to make them more accessible and cost-effective. The decreasing cost of batteries, coupled with a growing societal push towards clean energy, has led to an exponential growth in EV adoption, marking a true tipping point in the transportation sector. Diffusion: Fast Linear Growth Example: Smart Thermostats Why: The adoption of smart thermostats that allow users to control heating and cooling remotely has grown rapidly. Driven by consumer interest in energy savings and convenience, the market for these devices has expanded steadily, moving into the mainstream in many developed markets. Reconfiguration: Declining Growth Example: Traditional Hydropower Dams Why: Traditional hydropower dams, which have been a significant source of renewable energy, are now seeing declining growth in many regions. This decline can be attributed to environmental concerns, including the impact on aquatic ecosystems and the displacement of local communities. Additionally, the growth of alternative and more environmentally friendly renewable energy sources like wind and solar has led to a decreased emphasis on building new large-scale hydropower projects. The reconfiguration phase for traditional hydropower is characterized by a shift towards more sustainable practices, the exploration of smaller-scale hydro solutions, or even a reduction in new projects altogether. Thank you for accompanying us on this journey through Climate Tech. In the fourth part of our series, we'll direct our attention to a phenomenon that's both fascinating and frequently misunderstood: the Hype Curve. This isn't about sensationalism or fleeting trends. The Hype Curve represents a recurring pattern where technologies burst onto the scene, drawing attention and investment, only to later confront market complexities and challenges. What appears to be a chaotic cycle is, in fact, a discernible pattern. The rise and fall, the enthusiasm and skepticism, are part of a rhythmic dance that underlies technological adoption. In our next installment, we'll dissect the hype curves specific to various climate verticals, spanning Transportation, Agriculture, and Carbon Removal. It promises to be an insightful look into the mechanics of excitement, disillusionment, and realistic expectation-setting in the fast-evolving Climate Tech space.

Climate Drift,Technology Readiness Level: From Idea to Proven System,Navigating the Twists and Turns of Technology Readiness Levels with robots __,"Technology Readiness Level: From Idea to Proven System A short history The TRL model has a rich legacy. Its roots can be traced back to the pioneering era of space exploration at NASA during the 1970s. Created as a method to measure the maturity and readiness of a technology for space missions, the model has since been adopted by a wide array of organizations. Nasa engineers being happy that they just invented TRL (and landed man on the moon in the process) Since the 2000s, it has been utilized by the US Department of Defense as a scale for procurement and the European Commission advised EU-funded research and innovation projects to adopt the TRL scale in 2010. How does it work? The TRL model unfolds like a nine-chapter playbook. It kicks off at Level 1, sketching out the basic principles, then gradually adds layers of complexity and practical application. By the time we hit Level 9, we're no longer in the realm of theory - we have a proven system that works in a real-world environment. The TRL in praxis Let’s look at how the TRL is applied in real life: the Australian government is currently using it to rank climate solutions they want to support till 2030. They use TRL, combined with an extension (Commercial Readiness Index - RDI) to rank solutions from Small Modular Nuclear (TRL 5) to Carbon capture and storage in industry (TRL 8) . Next we will group the levels, explain them with robot gifs and add some climate solution examples. TRL 1 -3: Basic Technology Research Level 1: Basic research Basically just an idea. 💡 A walking, dancing humanoid robot would be great Level 2: Formulation of the idea and the use cases & applications At this point we have the idea on paper, and more paper describing how the idea might look like as a solution. “A humanoid robot it should be able to walk, dance and carry boxes…” Level 3: Proof of feasibility Aka studies were done. Now we are in the lab and the research has started for real. Concepts are being tried out, components are tested. We have studies, we can have the technology (perhaps in 6 levels). A good climate example here is fusion - Great idea, clearly formulated, with potential and a lot of studies (some projects are even slowly moving to Level 4). Some ideas can be stuck at Level 3 for decades (see fusion again). A lot of the noise (and headlines) in climate solutions are coming from this level. It is a vicious circle: A lot of early studies are pronounced as silver bullets by the media, before they are proven to a larger degree. They go viral, more studies are being picked by the media and blown up. TRL 4-5: Beginning Technology Development Level 4: Component or Prototype testing in a lab The arm moves (in a lab). Perhaps even rhythmically. One component at a time. Level 5: Component or Prototype testing in a realistic environment If it walks like a human, looks like a human in a self made Ironman suit… At this point the technology should work - aka we have actual technology. Now we just need 2 of the core ingredients of progress: time and money. Unfortunately it is often not clear how long a specific technology will need, or if it will be cheap or reliable enough for a large scale deployment. Typical examples for 4 & 5 in Climate Solutions are Hydrogen Aircraft and Electrified Steel Manufacturing . In the Australia example we have Small Reactor Nuclear . TRL 6–9: System Development Level 6: Full prototype tested in representative (realistic) environment Now we have left the lab, and we have entered a simulated or rebuild environment, a close, but not yet the actual environment. Look ma, it can lift heavy stuff now, the first step to dancing. Level 7: Full prototype tested in operational (actual) environment Takeoff! Now we have our prototype in its natural environment. It moves (naturally)! Let’s try to understand these levels with a fan favorite climate solution, the Tidal Energy Generator: In TRL 5 a small prototype would be tested in a realistic but controlled environment, for example a wave pool. In TRL 6 a full prototype would be tested near the shore in the sea. In TRL 7 a full prototype would be put out on deep sea. Level 8: Rigorous testing in actual environment Time to put the solution to the test: testing under realistic variables. Time to torture… I mean train the robot. Australia categorizes Carbon capture and storage in industry as a level 8 solution. Another example would be the integrated Grid. Level 9: Actual system proven through successful operations After a few years of real life use a system is proven - we now know long term problems and benefits of the solution. And we are done. It can dance. Peak human technology. An easy climate example of this: passenger EVs that are now already so long on the street that we know all lifecycle issues and are already starting to recycle batteries. Ah, the TRL scale - it's elegant, it's organized, but let's be real, it's not always a piece of cake to navigate. Placing a technology on the TRL scale can spark debates, lively discussions, and sometimes, a good old-fashioned argument. Why? Because tech maturity isn't a neat, linear journey from Point A to Point B. Think of it more like a winding path filled with unexpected twists, forks in the road, and the occasional U-turn. The complexity of the technology, its many possible applications, and how it meshes (or clashes!) with the existing ecosystem can all play a part in how mature it's perceived to be. Picture this: One expert points to a renewable energy tech, shouting, ""It's ready! Look at those successful pilots!"" (Level 9 vibes). Meanwhile, another expert jumps in, saying, ""Hold on! What about scalability? What about regulations?"" (Maybe it's more of a Level 6 situation?). The TRL scale is a valuable map, but it doesn't always spell out the exact location.

Climate Drift,Key Takeaways from IEA's new Net Zero Guide - Part 2,Bad News Everyone!,"Join Climate Drift : we explain climate solutions and help you find your part in the journey to net zero. Not on board yet? Signup here: Subscribe Hey 👋 Skander here. Welcome to Part 2 of our 2 parter on the IEA’s updated Pathway to Net Zero report. For Part 1, where we focussed on what is currently going well, go here: Today we are focussing on what is not going well. Let’s dive in 🌊 TLDR: 7 key challenges to Net Zero The report underscores several challenges in the global race to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, to limit global warming to 1.5°C. They highlight several key challenges: 1) Record high global carbon dioxide emissions from the energy sector in 2022, showcasing the dire state of climate crisis - we are not at peak emissions yet . 2) Although clean energy technologies are advancing, their pace is too slow to meet the 1.5°C goal, necessitating more aggressive climate policies & investments. 3) Infrastructure bottlenecks , such as time-consuming permitting processes and inadequate grids, hinder clean energy deployment. 4) Carbon Capture, Utilisation, and Storage (CCUS) technologies have underperformed historically, requiring further policy support. 5) The massive investment needed, especially in emerging markets, to scale up clean energy, with a sevenfold surge required in some areas by the early 2030s. 6) A looming supply gap for critical minerals essential for clean energy technologies, alongside a high geographical concentration in supply chains, raises risks of disruption. 7) The urgent need for international cooperation and enhanced ambition, as current commitments fall short of the net zero emissions goal by 2050. Let’s dive in and see what the challenges are. All graphs from the Massive investment is needed - especially in emerging economies Today more than 80% of clean energy investment is taking place in advanced economies and China; more is needed in emerging and developing economies. The NZE Scenario sees clean energy investment increasing nearly threefold from the current level by 2030, but fivefold in emerging market and developing economies other than China. Around USD 80-100 billion in annual concessional funding is needed by the early 2030s to lower the cost of finance and mobilise private capital in lower income countries. The milestones will be hard to reach The IEA gave 4 key milestones for the global electricity transition: 1. Triple renewables by 2030 2. Double grids investment by 2030 3. Phase-out coal by 2040 4. Double nuclear by 2050 Only in 1 of the 4 we are on a good track - renewables. Grid investments will be needed but hard, in the next section we are looking briefly at the lead times for these infrastructure projects, another core issue. Phasing out coal and other fossil fuels is very hard however: The IEA calls for a stop to new coal, oil and gas right now, but since the report went out - literally a day later - countries like the UK are already . Last week, top emitter China’s climate envoy said that phasing out fossil fuels completely was an “unrealistic” goal. Building takes time - and pages and pages of documents The planning and permitting phases for major new clean energy infrastructure are extensive, typically spanning three to eight years before construction can commence. This duration may extend further for First-Of-A-Kind projects. For projects like electricity lines and pipelines, the assessment of route plans often involves numerous regulatory bodies, jurisdictions, and stakeholders, each adding a layer of complexity to the approval process. When it comes to novel infrastructure types, such as CO2 storage sites, determining the responsible regulatory authority for the permitting process is not always straightforward. Large infrastructure projects usually traverse lands owned by multiple entities, necessitating early, frequent, and well-strategized stakeholder engagement to mitigate potential delays arising from public opposition. However, there seems to be a growing acknowledgment of the imperative to accelerate the permitting processes for clean energy infrastructure to address the pressing demands of energy transition efficiently - but red tape takes time to be cut. We need a lot of materials Clean energy technologies depend heavily on critical minerals like lithium, cobalt, nickel, and copper, requiring them for various components such as wind turbines, EV batteries, CO2 pipelines, and power grids. These technologies already consume significant portions of the total demand for these minerals, ranging from 15-55%. The ongoing expansion of clean energy solutions is contingent on the swift development of secure and sustainable critical mineral supply chains. Over the last decade, there has been a substantial increase in the extraction and processing capacity of critical minerals due to growing demands from the clean energy sector and other industries. From 2010 to 2022, the output of lithium mining has increased fivefold, while nickel and cobalt have doubled. This surge is especially prominent in recent years, with lithium output expanding by about 80%, nickel by about 35%, and cobalt by about 40% between 2020 and 2022 (IEA, 2023f). However, this increased supply has struggled to keep pace with rapidly growing demand, particularly for batteries, resulting in tight markets and price volatility. Lithium prices, for instance, have experienced the most fluctuations, increasing more than five times between the first half of 2020 and 2022. Investors are reacting to these price surges by announcing more projects for the extraction and processing of these crucial minerals, indicating a prospective supply expansion this decade. Announced lithium extraction projects alone increased by 14% between the end of 2022 and the second quarter of 2023. If these projects come to fruition, the anticipated supply would approximately meet 90% of copper, 80% of nickel, 65% of lithium, and 85% of cobalt demand levels by 2030 in the updated NZE Scenario. CCUS: overpromising and underdelivering CCUS (Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage) is a crucial technology, vital for reducing or eliminating emissions in sectors like cement production or synthetic kerosene manufacturing, where alternative solutions are scarce. However, CCUS has been marked by unfulfilled promises and stagnation, capturing only 0.1% of total annual energy sector emissions, representing 45 Mt annually, leading to its diminished role in climate mitigation scenarios. However, a resurgence has been observed since 2018, attributed to improved policies and market conditions, with over 45 countries now investing in CCUS projects. If all proposed projects are realized, we could witness an annual capture of about 400 Mt CO2 by 2030, a notable escalation from the current figures. The projections for 2030 include 20% of the capture capacity allocated for Direct Air Capture (DAC), 20% for hydrogen production, and 8% for industry. Despite the renewed interest, as of June 2023, only around 20 commercial capture projects have reached the final investment decision (FID) stage, and even if all planned projects are executed, they would satisfy only about 40% of the 1 Gt/year CO2 capture required by 2030 in the NZE Scenario. To meet the 2030 targets, project lead times, currently averaging six years, need to be significantly reduced. The adoption of best practices could decrease lead times to three to four years, and the establishment of CCUS hubs could offer further reductions. To reach a global capture capacity of 1 Gt CO2/year by 2030, planning for an average of 160 Mt CO2/year of capture capacity and 140 Mt CO2/year of storage capacity needs to commence each year between 2023 and 2026. The current pace of project announcements suggests that achieving the requisite global CO2 capture and storage capacity by 2030 is attainable, provided that supportive actions continue to be reinforced. Let’s end on some positive news Let’s finish this dive into the Net Zero Roadmap with some positive news - in true Climate Drift style - the progress across multiple industries.

The IEA’s report underlines the critical obstacles we face—be it the pressing need for massive investments, especially in emerging economies, the swift development of sustainable supply chains for critical minerals, the acceleration in the deployment of clean energy infrastructure, or the realization of the potential of CCUS technologies. The road ahead is long, and the milestones are hard to reach. Yet, in the midst of these challenges, let's not lose sight of the progress and the possibilities that lie ahead.

Not on board yet? Signup here: Subscribe Hey 👋 Skander here. There are many plans and roadmaps to help us reach Net Zero by 2050. The IEA's Roadmap to Net Zero is one of my favorites. It effectively builds upon their previous reports and explores a variety of topics, from technological progress to governmental commitments. Check out our favorite 10 roadmaps to reach Net Zero here: This week, the IEA has released an updated, extensive 226-page edition of their report. I will dedicate this post and the following to dive into it and share some insights in a shorter, Climate Drift friendly, format. I will start with a post highlighting some of the good news of the report. Let’s dive in 🌊 A quick Introduction to the IEA First, let’s introduce the IEA: The International Energy Agency (IEA) is an autonomous intergovernmental organization, headquartered in Paris, established in 1974 within the framework of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Originally conceived in response to the 1973 oil crisis, its role has evolved to ensure reliable, affordable, and clean energy, focusing on energy security, economic growth, and environmental sustainability. In March 2022, the IEA’s Ministerial Meeting extended its mandate to emphasize the clean energy transition, reflecting a global shift towards sustainability and climate-conscious energy policies. The IEA has historically faced criticism for underestimating the role and potential of renewable energy sources like photovoltaics and their declining costs in future energy systems. Various stakeholders, including environmental groups, investors, and companies, have urged the IEA to bolster its efforts in supporting the implementation of the Paris Agreement, advocating for stronger emphasis on renewables and sustainable energy solutions. Despite the criticisms, the IEA continues to be a major player in global energy policy, offering invaluable insights, data, and recommendations and publishing influential studies such as the Net Zero by 2050 report we are looking at today. TLDR: What does the Report say? Let’s dive right in: The IEA’s update to its 2021 report, ""Net Zero by 2050,"" focuses on the need for more and accelerated efforts to address the impacts of climate change, aligning with the 1.5°C global warming limit goal. August 2023 marked the hottest month recorded, after July 2023, underlining the urgency to act. The report presents a pathway for the energy sector, which is a major source of CO2 emissions, to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Despite new highs of 37 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions in 2022, positive developments and the adoption of clean energy technologies are pointing towards a peak in demand for coal, oil, and natural gas this decade. However, there are many milestones that will need to be reached: All graphs from the revised Net Zero by 2050 report. What happened so far - aka since the 2021 report? Governments have responded to the climate crisis and the global energy crisis, intensified by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, by adopting measures to promote clean energy technologies. Advances in solar PV installations and electric car sales are noteworthy, aligning with the set milestones in the 2021 report. If current manufacturing expansions are fully realized, the demand for solar PV and batteries could be met by 2030. What do we need to do? In order to bend the emission curve downward by 2030, accelerated improvements in energy efficiency, cutting methane emissions, and increasing electrification with existing technologies are imperative. These are most often cost-effective and can deliver over 80% of the required emission reductions by 2030. In this scenario, fossil fuel demand could decline by over 25% this decade, with energy sector CO2 emissions falling by 35% by 2030 compared to 2022 levels. Tripling global installed renewable capacity to 11,000 gigawatts by 2030 is also crucial for substantial emissions reduction. With policy reinforcement and international support, especially in emerging markets and developing economies, the global goal can be achievable. Accelerated electrification is essential, driven by booming technologies like electric vehicles and heat pumps. Cutting methane emissions by 75% by 2030 is also crucial as one of the least cost opportunities to curb global warming in the short term. Accelerate Innovation Investment in clean energy needs to significantly climb from a record USD 1.8 trillion in 2023 to around USD 4.5 trillion a year by the early 2030s, with a sharper focus on emerging market and developing economies other than China. With sufficient investments, no new coal, oil, and natural gas projects would be needed, and fossil fuel demand could be cut by more than 25% by 2030 and 80% in 2050. Accelerate Investment Innovation is important to reducing reliance on non-existent market technologies for emission reductions. Also, a ""build big"" mentality for infrastructure like smarter grids, CCUS technologies, and low-emission fuels is needed, with policies to expedite decision-making and foster international cooperation. Bridging the supply and demand gap for critical minerals is necessary to avoid disruptions from geopolitical tensions and extreme weather events, ensuring supply chain resilience. Electricity, being the ""new oil,"" requires secure and flexible supplies with a massive expansion of battery energy storage and dispatchable low-emission capacity. In a secure and affordable net-zero emissions transition, households, especially low-income ones, need support to meet the higher upfront costs of clean energy technologies. Let’s first look at what is going well: Technological progress These 4 graphs show remarkable growth in 4 key solutions: Solar PV capacity surged by over 400% , adding almost 1 terawatt (TW) of capacity, nearly the total installed electricity capacity across the European Union. The sales of electric cars experienced a skyrocketing increase of around 2,000% , totaling over 25 million sales during this period. This number surpasses the total number of cars currently on the roads in Canada. The market for residential heat pumps saw a 225% increase in sales, totaling around 600 GW, almost the entire residential heating capacity found in Russia. Stationary battery storage saw a monumental increase in capacity additions, rising by 2,500% . Nearly 45 GW was installed, almost the total installed electricity capacity in Argentina. In 2022, the collective global market for five important clean energy technologies—solar PV, wind, batteries, electrolysers, and heat pumps—experienced a surge, reaching just below USD 300 billion, marking nearly a 20% increase from the year before. Since 2010, the market value of these five technologies has nearly tripled, coinciding with an approximately 80% decline in their unit costs - thanks to learning and producing at scale. We covered the framework behind this in How Solar Got Cheap Without these cost reductions, an additional $1 trillion in investment would have been needed in 2022 to attain the level of deployment achieved that year. Sales predominantly grew in major markets such as China, North America, and the European Union. If we zoom in we can see that EV batteries and stationary storage applications accounted for 65% of the market expansion in 2022, mostly because of the substantial global uptick in electric car sales, which rose from almost 7 million in 2021 to over 10 million in 2022, representing a jump from 9% to 14% of global car sales respectively. But are we producing enough? Good news first: If all anticipated solar PV module manufacturing projects are realized, the output would exceed the deployment needs of the updated NZE Scenario for 2030 by around 30%. Likewise, the demands for EV and grid storage batteries in 2030 would almost be entirely satisfied under the same conditions. However, intentions are not implementations: these projects often need to finalized, fully funded and constructed. Currently, only around 25% of globally announced projects for solar PV manufacturing and about 30% for batteries are firmly committed. The commitment is even more sparse, around 5%, for electrolysers essential for hydrogen production. The situation is also challenging for wind power. Despite the manufacturing capacity for crucial wind turbine components experiencing a slight increase—around 2% in 2022—many wind manufacturers are encountering obstacles in escalating production. These are primarily due to disruptions in supply chains and increased costs, ramifications of the Covid-19 pandemic, and geopolitical strains, which followed a period characterized by decreasing costs and rapid expansion in the wind sector. More good news: Most countries are working towards Net Zero Reaching net zero emissions by 2050 requires action on the part of all countries. Different countries have varying starting points, capacities, and resources. Thankfully, things are starting to move, as of September 2023, over 85% of global energy-related emissions and nearly 90% of global GDP are encompassed by net zero pledges, with 94 countries and the European Union committed to such targets. These pledges, though not possessing the legal binding of NDCs under the Paris Agreement, are important as indicators of national ambitions towards the collective goal of net zero emissions. But pledges are not binding yet. This is also starting to change: Several countries have institutionalized these targets in national law, particularly advanced economies in Asia Pacific and Europe. However, in many emerging and developing economies, such commitments are often non-legally binding or are merely oral pledges. In the Middle East and North Africa, substantial gaps in commitment persist. Most pledges are comprehensive, covering all sectors including energy, but the inclusion of land-use sectors as emission sinks often slows the perceived pace of energy-sector emissions reductions compared to IEA scenarios. More transparent and distinct emission reduction and removal targets would enhance clarity and confidence in these commitments. This overview has highlighted the optimistic advancements, the positive shifts in governmental policies, and the momentum in clean energy technology adoption. However, we've only scratched the surface of the report and while it’s crucial to acknowledge and build on our successes, it's equally important to understand and address the challenges and areas where progress is lagging.

Climate Drift,How to use Toasters and Bricks to reduce 25% of global emissions - Part 2,Introducing Rondo,"TLDR: The Rondo Heat Battery delivers 24/7 zero-carbon, economical industrial heat, fueled by affordable renewable electricity. It supplies on-demand high-temperature heat as hot air, steam, or hot water, enabling customers to reduce operating costs while utilizing zero-carbon energy continuously. It takes a village to build a company - and a village leader Let’s first take a look at Rondos leadership - and it’s founder and CEO John O’Donnell. Currently Rondo is a fairly small company: it scaled to 90 people this year. Originally a computer scientist working on fusion research, John O’Donnell ventured into various tech sectors with 6 startups, from Semiconductors to supercomputers. In 2005 energy technologies was the next disruptive frontier, triggering his shift to climate tech. In exploring solutions, he realized the significance of the solar thermal space and the potential it held for generating industrial heat - leading him to cofound 2 companies in the space: GlassPoint Solar and Ausra. However, scaling solar thermal posed significant challenges, culminating in the company's acquisition by French giant Areva. John shifted for a few months to look at , but he found his Moby Dick: How to solve the Industrial Heat problem? Want to dive into Carbon Removal? Check out our guide here: Research led him and his team to a 1828 patent used by the steel industry—a blast stove storing high-temperature heat in bricks. After 78 design iterations, they succeeded in leveraging this high heat capacity, durable, and economical material, overcoming its brittleness and low heat conductivity, paving the way for sustainable, large-scale solutions and Rondo in its current form. The Unlock - what changed now? The landscape of renewable energy has undergone a transformative evolution, primarily driven by advancements in wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) technologies over the last 15 years. A staggering 95% reduction in costs has elevated intermittent electricity to a new paradigm, positioning it as the most affordable form of energy ever known to humanity. Want to learn more about How Solar got cheap? Dive into our primer. To recap our so far, historically, utilizing fossil fuels for generating heat was the most cost-effective method due to the high costs of alternative energy sources. However, the emergence of cheaper renewable energy, particularly wind and solar power, has begun to alter this dynamic. The hurdle we face now is converting the intermittent energy supplied by wind and solar into constant heat, a requirement for many industrial applications, including smelters, factories, and various production plants. These applications operate continuously, often for months or years, and any interruption can cause significant damages and delays, making reliability crucial. Unlike fossil fuels, which can generate energy continuously as long as fuel is available, renewable energy sources are dependent on environmental conditions. Wind power relies on wind speeds, and solar power depends on sunlight, both of which are not constant and can vary significantly  - they are intermittent. Some industrial processes however are so sensitive that a mere half-second interruption in energy supply could lead to a week-long restart process. Thus, the conversion of plentiful intermittent electricity into a constant supply, at prices below those of fossil fuels, is the challenge to solve. Other tailwinds: Regulatory and social On the regulatory side we are seeing a wave of varied public policies, such as the European ETS, influencing carbon prices globally due to the newly implemented carbon border adjustment mechanism - Policies in countries like Canada, establishing nationwide carbon prices, and numerous other jurisdictions are creating markets where investing in carbon prices is becoming a reality - forcing industry to rethink and rework their processes. Additionally, corporations are taking steps themselves by opting for low-carbon commodities, exemplified by the trading of low-carbon aluminum at a premium over its conventional counterpart on global exchanges. Multiple factors, including the base economics of power access and the relative costs and availability of fuels and renewable energy, are driving these shifts. How it works: Thermal storage Consider the common coffee thermos on your desk; it's a real-time energy storage device. Imagine filling your thermos with hot coffee and wrapping it in multiple blankets; when opened three days later, you'll find the coffee still retains its heat. Unlike chemical systems subject to self-discharge, the stored energy in such a setup can only dissipate through insulation to the surroundings or be transferred to a target object. In fact, the energy retained in your thermos can surpass that in your laptop battery, and it does so more economically. Presently, storing heat, as in a thermos, is a relatively inexpensive process. What components are involved? There's hot water, capable of retaining significant energy per degree of heat, encased within an insulating barrier. The efficacy of the insulation determines the duration for which energy can be stored. A short history of industrial heat storage So, if this is such a clear and proven technology - why are we not using it? Well surprise: As of now, approximately 30 gigawatts of heat storage are active globally. This is 10x the storage of lithium ion batteries in the world (around 3 gigawatts). The concept of heat storage is ; the first patent for a heat storage device, named the Cowper stove, was issued in 1828. This invention features a tower filled with a thousand tons of brick, structured with air passages, operating on a 1-hour cycle. The device utilizes the residual heat from blast furnace exhaust to heat the bricks to approximately 1500°C. For around 20 minutes, fresh air is circulated through the tower, delivering 115 megawatts of heat to the furnace before the cycle repeats. This cyclical heating and cooling process occurs 24 times a day, and these structures have a lifespan of about 30 years. Currently, there are a million tons of such bricks in service in blast furnaces worldwide, demonstrating the longstanding and extensive application of heat storage in industrial processes. Rondo’s breakthrough: Combining this with a toaster Brick is renowned for being a poor conductor of heat, hence its frequent use in constructing fireplaces. For efficient heating, the brick must be heated uniformly; an imbalance, like one side in water and the other in fire, can lead to fracturing. However, when placed centrally within a fire, it can quickly attain the fire's temperature. It's a seemingly evident concept but one that required 80 iterations to perfect. If you look inside a Rondo unit, you'll notice a structure composed of bricks arranged to create open chambers, forming a checkerboard pattern of bricks and open boxes. Integrated within this structure are electric heaters - based on the same technologies found in toasters - which generate radiant heat within these chambers. And as you might recall (I didn’t) - the thermal radiation of any object in the universe is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature. Objects in proximity exchange heat until equilibrium is reached, resulting in uniform temperature. This is the discovery that enabled Rondo to efficiently heat the bricks with toaster technology in between each brick and achieve 98% efficiency. Let’s see how this compares to the other industrial decarbonisation paths we looked at in Part 1: Business Model: How Rondo is making money As it stands, businesses, whether they are producing baby food or steel, typically don't source their fuel; they procure energy as a service, allocating their capital primarily to their core processes. Industrial heat could be one of the most lucrative business opportunities of our era: Global TAM (total addressable market) for Industrial Heat could be $1 trillion ($107 billion in US). Of course there are a lot of possibilities how heat can be provided and financed, one just needs to look at the diverse solutions in the realm of conventional gas and steam turbines: Some entities operate their own cogeneration plants, while others might contract external services for their electricity or heat needs. jI expect that the 'renewable heat as a service' sector will evolve similarly. If one zooms out at the potential stakeholder influencing this market: In the U.S. there's already a thriving community of developers adept at optimizing costs for solar and wind energy projects, though many haven't explored industrial facilities. In Europe, there are already developers initiating renewable industrial heat projects. Rondo is currently providing 2 ways to work with them: Buy your own heat battery: They offer commissioned, guaranteed installed heat batteries across four continents, allowing customers to reap the complete economic advantages of generating their own heat and power at a cost below that of fossil fuels. Heat as a Service: They are pioneering and financing 'heat as a service,' with a primary focus on North America. This service is currently tailor-made to ensure low and predictable power costs without the necessity for upfront capital. They collaborate with each customer to determine the best financing structure and terms to suit their individual needs. Another market dynamic that influences this is that the deployment of wind and solar is experiencing a slowdown — not due to a decline in demand — but due to congestion issues. This is touching upon another problem that Rondo might solve: The interconnection queue time, the time for new renewable projects to connect to the grid, is currently staggering, standing at 13 years in England and 4 years in the US. Solving the interconnection queue: Creating Islands of renewable Industrial Heat Rondo’s first model, the RHB 300, requires 70 megawatts of electricity. Typically, installations at a single site may house between two to ten of these units. This quickly scales up to utility-scale energy demand - however this can also be constructed without any grid connection. The concept is to construct a solar or wind farm that exclusively connects to these batteries. The produced heat from the batteries is then sold, eliminating any dependence on the electricity grid. This means there is no waiting for interconnection or any other grid-related delays. Given the low cost of wind and solar energy, the potential implications and applications are vast. However the obstacles are clear: Compare purchasing heat from a traditional boiler to purchasing heat from an entity that constructed an entire utility-scale renewable energy installation and multiple heat batteries - this might intuitively seem more expensive. The affordability of wind and solar energy in the current market makes this option competitively priced - and Islands of renewable Industrial Heat a possibility. How much electricity would we need for Industrial Heat? The International Energy Agency (IEA) conducted an evaluation of industrial heat, concluding that approximately 9000 gigawatts of new generation will be essential to supplant the current usage of oil, coal, and natural gas. In the context of the United States, the effect on electric demand is anticipated to surpass the combined total of ground transport and building heat, presenting a load comparable to current electricity consumption levels. How far along is Rondo? One of Rondo’s first deployments Whether the production involves converting soybeans or animal fats into renewable diesel, or corn into ethanol, nearly half of the carbon footprint of alternative fuels is attributed to the burning of fossil fuels during production. However, Rondo has the capability to reduce this carbon intensity to zero, enabling the production of biofuels with approximately half the current carbon intensity. Integrating carbon capture eradicates the remaining half, achieving, in essence, a fuel with zero carbon intensity. In 2023, Rondo began operations of its first commercial unit, lowering the carbon intensity of biofuel produced by Calgren Renewable Fuels. This project was the first commercially operating electric thermal energy storage system in the US, and the highest efficiency, highest temperature energy storage of any kind worldwide. Also in 2023 Rondo, in partnership with (largest cement company in SEA), announced current Heat Battery storage production capacity of 2.4GWh/year, with plans to reach 90GWh/year. A quick technoeconomics study Emissions: A single 20MW renewable steam generator developed by Rondo is responsible for zero CO2 emissions annually, presenting a stark contrast to a 20MW gas-fired steam generator which emits approximately 44,000 tons of CO2 per year. Electricity price : The primary cost driver for Rondo is the price of electricity required for charging (aka heating up the bricks), necessitating low prices for approximately 6-8 hours daily. If Rondo scales this will be the highest variable for Levelized Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH). CapEx (Capital Expenditure) is currently significant, as Rondo is just starting out with their learning curve. Heater replacement frequency : Rondo primarily employs non-moving and standardized components, like the bricks. The current lifetime of a Rondo system should be comparable to the proven steel systems described above - so around 30 yea Efficiency & core technology : Already solved for Rondo with 98% efficiency. The competition There are many other ways to store heat thermally apart from bricks: from Liquids like Molten Salt and Molten Metal, to other Solids like Graphite. In the end I think this will not be a winner takes all market, there will be many other entrants to the race to decarbonize industrial heat. I wanted to highlight one: Antora Antora is using Carbon blocks, made out of Graphite, again heated with electricity from renewable sources with a toaster principle. Additionally to selling the heat, they also focus on thermophotovoltaic cells to convert this stored heat back into electricity. Solar Photovoltaic Cells convert sun rays into electricity, thermophotovoltaic cells convert heat into electricity. Antora’s future projects will be with companies in the chemicals, mining, food and beverage, and oil and gas industries. Some of those projects are expected to come online as early as 2025. Antora recently raised $50m in a Series A from Breakthrough Energy, Lowercarbon Capital and D3. . What created my interest in Rondo and the issue they aim to address are primarily two aspects: Firstly, the magnitude—targeting 25% of all emissions represents a significant and impactful endeavor. Secondly, it’s their approach—marrying age-old principles with contemporary innovations to create new solutions. We have many more challenges waiting in decarbonisation that might be tackled with reinvented solutions.

Haven't joined yet? Subscribe now: Subscribe Hey there 👋 Skander here! Welcome to a new format at Climate Drift: Company Deep Dives . Today we start with Rondo, a company aiming to significantly reduce global emissions - how significantly? Their stated goal is reducing 1% of world emissions in a decade. But this is not where their ambition stops: in 15 years they want to reach 15%. So far they have dozens of pilots running and hundreds more in the pipeline. They raised more than $100 million, with their last round of $60 million this year coming from tier 1 climate funds: Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Energy Impact Partners, John Doerr and industrial leaders including Microsoft's Climate Innovation Fund, Rio Tinto, SABIC and Aramco Ventures. How do they want to do it? Combine a toaster with bricks, and decarbonize industrial heat. Today we are first looking at the problem of Industrial Heat, tomorrow we are diving deep into Rondo. Let’s dive in 🌊 Intro Industrial heat accounts for 26% of the total global energy consumption. It’s a crucial component in diverse manufacturing processes, be it creating baby food, fuel, cement, or steel, where the majority of energy is used in the form of heat as opposed to electricity. Recently, the Department of Energy highlighted that in the United States, the predominant sectors utilizing industrial heat are, in descending order: chemicals, food and beverage, paper products—including a range from toilet paper to cardboard—cement, and finally, steel. Heat is not equal heat however; for instance, chemicals need about one-third to 50% of all heat in the form of steam, whereas, for food and beverages and paper products, it's primarily steam. On the other end of the scale, for cement and steel manufacturing, steam is not utilized. The newest way to decarbonise this heat is a new category of battery, coined as “rocks in a box.” This technology stores renewable energy as heat in diverse materials, from sand to graphite, ensuring a consistent supply of heat for all industrial needs. Rondo is emerging as a new player in this domain, developing a rocks in a box battery that efficiently stores heat in bricks. But first: let’s dive into the problem of industrial heat. From McKinsey’s study on decarbonizing Industry 🔥 Heat is not uniform When considering heat for both buildings and industry, one thing is sure: they use a lot of fossil fuels. In Europe approximately 60% of all the natural gas is consumed for heat. However, the utilization of industrial heat is diverse, segmented primarily by the varying temperature requirements of different processes. For instance, cooking processes generally require heat around 150°C in the form of steam, whereas manufacturing cement demands much higher temperatures, around 1800°C. In the grand scheme of industrial applications, about 95% of total heat is deployed in processes that operate below 1500°C. More specifically, nearly half to two-thirds of industrial heat applications function below 400°C. Industries have distinctive needs; for example, high-temperature industries are relatively specialized and limited, primarily involving steel and concrete production. However, in lower temperature ranges where steam suffices, there are many smaller, varied industries utilizing heat. For now Rondo is focussed on steam, so lower temperatures, as it covers most usecases. Let’s take a step back: Why is industry currently using fuels and not electricity? Historically, the use of off-grid electricity as a primary source of industrial heat has faced significant limitations - the major one being conversion loss: When electricity is generated in a power station, only about 40% of the energy obtained from burning fuel is converted into electricity; the rest is lost as waste heat. Furthermore, an additional 5% to 10% of the generated electricity is lost during transmission to the end-user. The inherent inefficiency in power generation and transmission, coupled with the operational costs of maintaining power stations and the grid, has historically rendered the cost per unit of electricity substantially higher than that of burning fuel directly. Consequently, it has generally been more energy-efficient and cost-effective to burn fuel locally rather than relying on electricity generated from a distant power station. Let’s take a step to the side: 4 ways to decarbonize industry As we know: burning fossil fuels is creating a lot of emissions. How can we decarbonise industry then? One quick look at our Solutions Map for Industry shows many different pathways: Tap/Click to zoom in and explore Time to simplify it to 4 approaches: 1. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS): This is business as usual - but integrates technologies to capture emissions produced and store them underground. This strategy aims to mitigate the environmental impact without altering the processes in place. There are limits however: economical, storage wise, public perception and more. Let’s look at this in other deep dive. 2. Hydrogen: A deep dive is also essential for this option, but tldr: it involves converting energy to hydrogen and utilizing it as a fuel source, akin to conventional fuels. In a lot of ways this is fossil fuels with extra steps. A note on Hydrogen Hydrogen decarbonisation works by producing hydrogen, which is then compressed, stored, and combusted (similar to current fossil fuels). While the cost of electrolyzers is decreasing, the process's overall efficiency is hampered by the laws of physics, yielding approximately one unit of heat for every two units of electricity - due to the involved chemical steps. If we look at current industrial boiler systems, where 95% of lifetime cost is fuel, upgrading boilers to run on alternative fuels like Hydrogen becomes economically sensible only when the fuel's economics are favorable. Also think about the conversion loss: Hydrogen storage loses about 50% of energy through conversions, whereas lithium-ion batteries offer varying efficiencies, up to 90%. In contrast, thermal energy storage retrieves 90% to 95% of stored heat. 3. Batteries: This alternative focuses on storing energy not as heat but as electrons, through the use of large-scale grid battery storage. While viable, this method tends to be significantly more expensive and less efficient. For example, even the most efficient lithium-ion systems operate at around 90% efficiency, with the remaining 10% lost as heat during the storage process. And modern batteries are expensive to produce and are needed for decarbonizing other sectors (like transportation). Just a few months ago, Tesla unveiled their third master plan, detailing their vision for a fully decarbonized world. According to their blueprint, in a world powered by electric thermal storage for industries, we would require twice as much capacity as we would need for batteries connected to the grid to achieve full decarbonization. 4. Thermal Energy Storage (“Rocks in a Box”): This solution involves converting and storing energy in the form of heat instead of combustion, allowing the stored heat to be utilized as needed. This method is emerging as a feasible alternative, offering a balance between efficiency and sustainability - and is the focus of Rondo. That was our quick dive into the problem of Industrial Heat and 4 pathways to solve it.

Haven't joined the movement? Subscribe now: Subscribe Hey there 👋 Skander here! The software world took 40 years to hit 25M employees. Now, the climate sector has to rally 250M people in under a decade. This is a recruitment drive at a scale unseen so far. Or is it? The US has tried to do something similar before with the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression - and it was successful, employing 3m people over the first 9 years of the program.. This week, Biden learned from history and launched the American Climate Corps. Let’s learn what the old CCC was and the new ACC aims to be. Let’s dive in 🌊 The Origin: The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) The (CCC) was a U.S. government initiative from 1933-1942, targeting unemployed, unmarried men aged 18-25, later broadening to 17-28. A cornerstone of Roosevelt's New Deal, the CCC offered jobs in conservation and natural resource development on government-owned rural lands. Created during the Great Depression, the CCC aimed to provide jobs and financial relief to struggling families. At its peak, 300,000 men enrolled. Over its 9 years of existence, 3 million young men participated, receiving shelter, clothing, food, and a monthly wage of $30 (with $25 sent home). Adjusted for inflation, that's roughly $678 today. The CCC was the New Deal's star player, gaining massive public support. Beyond its immediate economic relief, the CCC also fostered a deeper connection between Americans and their natural landscapes, emphasizing the importance of conservation - if you hike in the US today you will still come across many CCC projects. The CCC tackled a diverse range of projects, falling into nine key categories: Structural Improvements: Including bridges, service buildings, and fire lookout towers. Transportation : Development of truck trails, minor roads, footpaths, and airfields. Erosion Control: Techniques such as check dams, terracing, and planting vegetation. Flood Control: Encompassing irrigation, drainage, dam construction, and more. Forestry : Tree planting, fire prevention and control, and pest management. Recreation & Landscape: Crafting public campsites, picnic areas, and developing lakes and ponds. Range Management: Creating stock driveways and managing predatory animals. Wildlife Conservation: Stream improvements, fish stocking, and habitat creation. Miscellaneous Tasks: Emergency responses, surveying, and mosquito control. The CCC was a huge intergovernmental effort: Four departments collaboratively managed it. Labor (doing recruitment), War (camp operations), Agriculture, and Interior (organizing and project supervision). In summary, the original CCC was a groundbreaking initiative. While some might see it as a strong application of socialism (a debate for another day), it undeniably lifted many from poverty, helped the US navigate the Great Depression more effectively, and mobilized masses to engage in environmental work. Enter: A new CCC - the Civilian Climate Corps Upon taking office, Biden marked climate change as one of his top 4 priorities, setting an ambitious target to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 50% of 2005 levels within the decade. And the new Civilian Climate Corps was on the top of the agenda: Within his inaugural week, Biden expressed his intent through an executive order: He envisioned this corps as a means to empower a new wave of conservationists, focusing on resilience, extensive training, and job creation. The idea of a Civilian Climate Corps (CCC) resonates across party lines and with a broader population. Recent polling from Data for Progress reveals that 77% of respondents endorse the CCC initiative. This includes a significant 65% of Republicans and an overwhelming 87% of Democrats. from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication also found that 83 percent of Americans support reestablishing the New Deal-era Civilian Conservation Corps. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act earmarked a substantial $369 billion for climate-related incentives and expenditures - and originally planned $30 billion for ""mobilizing the next generation of conservation and resilience workers"" for the creation of the Civilian Climate Corps. Unfortunately this did not happen - the program . Sen. Bernie Sanders proposed an amendment to reintroduce the Civilian Climate Corps to the package. However, Democrats uniformly resisted the amendment, emphasizing the need to maintain the bill's integrity. They also rejected all amendments put forth by Republicans. Politicians like AOC pushed for the idea of a CCC The Civilian Climate Corps didn’t die however: in a by organisations like the Sunrise Movement and through political force some money was found: The House passed a package allotting $31 million for it in summer of 2023, and the Senate proposed $20 million for related work through the National Park Service. In the Inflation Reduction Act one can find  $500 million for the Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management to pursue conservation and ecosystem restoration on public lands - which could also be used to build a new CCC and an additional $500 million is earmarked for the Park Service to hire new employees. This of course falls short of the $30 billion originally planned. So this leads us to this week: The announcement of the new CCC at the Climate Week in NY. The new CCC - the American Climate Corps Let’s take it directly from the announcement: Today, through his Investing in America agenda, President Biden is delivering on that commitment by taking executive action to launch the American Climate Corps – a workforce training and service initiative that will ensure more young people have access to the skills-based training necessary for good-paying careers in the clean energy and climate resilience economy. The American Climate Corps will mobilize a new, diverse generation of more than 20,000 Americans – putting them to work conserving and restoring our lands and waters, bolstering community resilience, deploying clean energy, implementing energy efficient technologies, and advancing environmental justice, all while creating pathways to high-quality, good-paying clean energy and climate resilience jobs in the public and private sectors after they complete their paid training program. So what is the plan? Training & Opportunities: The Corps will train young Americans in clean energy, conservation, and climate resilience. They'll work on projects ranging from restoring coastal areas to deploying clean energy. All positions are paid and lead to quality job opportunities. No prior experience is needed for most roles. Centralized Recruitment: The Federal government will soon unveil a recruitment site for the Corps, centralizing the application process. Key Federal departments will coordinate closely, with a memorandum to solidify their collaboration. AmeriCorps will also support through a dedicated hub. Educational Awards: AmeriCorps is expanding access to Segal AmeriCorps Education Awards, which awarded $4B so far, for Climate Corps members. These awards help members fund further education or pay off student debts. Simplified Civil Service Entry: A proposal from the Office of Personnel Management aims to make it easier for participants to transition into federal roles, especially those in national or tribal service programs. How will it look like in reality? For a tangible peek into what's to come, let's look at the freshly launched ForestCorp. A collaboration between AmeriCorps and the U.S. Forest Service, this $15 million initiative will train young individuals next year, ages 18-26, in wildfire prevention, reforestation, and more. Participants can expect compensation around $15 per hour, with perks covering lodging, transportation, attire, health benefits, and a living allowance. No prior qualifications are needed to dive in. AmeriCorps, the federal agency for national service, isn't new to the climate battle. In 2022, they invested over $117 million into climate resilience and environmental conservation, marking a 20% leap from the year before. Last year alone, 14,500 AmeriCorps members contributed to environmental conservation—preserving vast land expanses, educating individuals on conservation, and rejuvenating waterways. Some issues Funding : The proposed budget for the Climate Corps is notably modest in comparison to historical benchmarks. For perspective, the original Civilian Conservation Corps received about $3 billion during its nine-year tenure, which equates to roughly $66 billion when adjusted for inflation. Given the pressing challenge of climate change, our present funding commitment seems less robust. Unlike the well-defined budget of its predecessor, the financing details for the new initiative remain unclear. Administration officials have yet to specify the program's exact funding or the sources of its allocation. Lacking central organization: The original initiative was a monumental organizational endeavor, requiring seamless collaboration across various departments and agencies. It showcased a structured approach, wherein roles, responsibilities, and objectives were clearly delineated. In contrast, the structure for the current initiative seems ambiguous. There's a noticeable absence of a centralized framework guiding its operations, leaving many stakeholders in the dark about its direction and integration across departments. From battling the dire straits of the Great Depression to now confronting the looming specter of climate change, both the CCC and the ACC reflect a commitment to harnessing the collective power of the American people in service of the greater good. While the modern iteration faces its unique set of challenges—like funding ambiguities and the need for a more centralized command structure—the spirit remains the same: creating opportunities, fostering environmental stewardship, and leaving a mark on the nation's landscape and emissions. I believe that for the corps to truly make a significant impact, there needs to be an overwhelming response from potential applicants. If the demand exceeds the current slots available, it could potentially drive the necessary funding and planning it deserves.

Welcome to the last Part, Part 4, of our series where we dive into solution maps across 12 areas, ranging from Transportation to Energy and Water. Today it is time for… Transportation, Energy and Water. As always for each map, I've provided a concise overview, targeting around 200 words for brevity. Let’s dive in 🌊 Click/tap to zoom in Transportation Over the past thirty years, economic growth and increased car reliance have driven up emissions from transport. Though we are making progress on some fronts there is a long way to go by rail (get it?). Check out our exploration along the Hype Curve of the Transportation Solutions: First, while cities are trending towards sustainable transport modes like rapid transit and bicycles, this shift must accelerate to align with climate targets. Access to low-carbon travel options, like improved bike lanes and efficient public transit, is vital. Second, the popularity of private cars needs fall. Travel by passenger cars grew from 39% in 2015 to 44% in 2020. Thirdly, the rise of zero-emission vehicles presents a beacon of progress. Electric vehicles (EVs) accounted for nearly 9% of light-duty sales in 2021, doubling from 2020. With the right policies, EVs are increasingly rivaling traditional vehicles in cost. Zero-carbon heavy-duty vehicles, though a small portion of 2022's sales, saw a notable increase, and zero-emission bus sales skyrocketed, largely fueled by China's market. Lastly, the maritime and aviation sectors require a zero-carbon transformation. Sustainable aviation fuels are slowly gaining traction, as seen by recent substantial purchase agreements. Meanwhile, innovations like green hydrogen and e-methanol in maritime shipping hint at a zero-emission future. Click/tap to zoom in Power The global power sector is evolving rapidly. Since 2010, renewables have become increasingly cost-effective, challenging traditional fossil fuels like coal. For an intro on this, check out How Solar got Cheap: By 2019, zero-carbon sources, such as renewables and nuclear, provided 36.4% of global energy, a rise from 32.3% in 2010. Despite these advancements, coal's dominance persists in areas like China, and post-COVID, there's been a surge in fossil gas-based power. Notably, 2021 saw record power system emissions. Russia's actions in Ukraine have rekindled Europe's reliance on fossil fuels due to gas shortages, causing nations like Austria and Germany to momentarily turn back to coal. We need to build out and improve Renewables, while also improving our Grid, making it smart, keeping up with maintenance and building out new transmission lines. Storage is another solutions field that saw a lot of progress and will need even more. Last but not least: how can we make sure that our current fossil fuel extraction and infrastructure is the least impactful it has ever been, while we face it out. Water Climate change poses significant challenges to the global water supply, affecting precipitation patterns, glacial melt rates, and evaporation, which in turn impact both the quantity and quality of available freshwater. As populations grow and water becomes scarcer, it is important to implement innovative solutions to manage this critical resource effectively. Conservation is key. Monitoring and Efficiency tools, such as smart meters and advanced sensor networks, offer real-time data on water use, enabling municipalities and individuals to make informed consumption choices. Wastewater recycling transforms used water into a viable supply source, reducing the demand on fresh resources. Irrigation techniques, like drip irrigation, target water delivery to where it's most needed, reducing wastage in agricultural settings. Lastly, Purification systems, such as biofiltration and reverse osmosis, ensure that water is safe for consumption, irrespective of its source. Beyond conservation, Extraction methods can tap previously underutilized sources. Desalination turns seawater into drinkable water, albeit with energy and environmental concerns. Rainwater harvesting systems capture and store precipitation for domestic and agricultural use, reducing strain on groundwater. Atmospheric water extraction devices, still in their infancy, promise to draw moisture directly from the air. In the face of climate change, a strategy that combines conservation and extraction ensures a sustainable water future.

Welcome to Part 3 of our series where we dive into solution maps across 12 areas, ranging from Energy to Circular Economy and Transportation. Today we dive into Food & Agriculture, Carbon Removal & Offsets and Protecting Nature. In Part 1 we look into our solutions map for the Industry, Built Environment, and Workforce sectors. Part 2 offers insights into our solutions map for the Climate Finance, the Circular Economy and Software-First Solutions. For each map, I've provided a concise overview, targeting around 200 words for brevity. Let’s dive in 🌊 Click/tap to zoom in and explore Food & Agriculture To sustainably feed an estimated 10 billion people by 2050, our global food system must undergo significant transformation. This entails not only meeting the demand without expanding agricultural land or harming biodiversity but also drastically reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Several critical Food & Agriculture areas need urgent solutions: Agricultural Practices: We must halt agricultural land expansion and focus on sustainably increasing crop yields. Between 2015 and 2019, direct emissions from agriculture rose by 2%. While this is a modest increase, it highlights the urgency for substantial changes to meet 2030 and 2050 emission reduction targets. The growth in crop yields must quicken sixfold in the next decade. Ruminant Meat Consumption: High-income countries need to reduce their ruminant meat (beef, lamb, and goat) intake significantly. Thankfully we have a wide range of alternative proteins at our disposal. We also need to ensure that any remaining consumption is met through efficient means, like enhancing feed efficiency and pasture productivity. Tackling Food Waste: Globally, 14% of food is lost between production and processing, while an additional 17% is wasted at the consumption level (UNEP, 2021d). Addressing this inefficiency requires a full new batch of solutions. Tap/Click to zoom in Carbon Removal & Offsets Simply reducing emissions across all value chains, while important, will not suffice. To truly combat rising global temperatures and counteract the decades of greenhouse gases we have already released into the atmosphere, we must also actively remove existing emissions. In addition, offsetting provides another avenue to help balance the carbon ledger. Carbon removal techniques, on the left side of the map, such as afforestation, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), and direct air capture, offer promising solutions. These methods aim to extract carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere and either store it safely or repurpose it. To learn more about Carbon Removal check out our Guide to the Carbon Removal Hype On the other hand, carbon offsets are essentially investments in projects that reduce or remove greenhouse gas emissions, allowing entities to compensate for their emissions. Whether it's by supporting wind farms, reforestation projects, or innovative green technologies, offsets can play a role in closing the gap between actual emissions and emission reduction targets. To learn more about Carbon Offsets check out our Offset Explainer Series Protecting Nature To limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C, immediate action is required to preserve and sustainably manage natural carbon sinks like forests, peatlands, and mangroves. These measures could mitigate up to 7.3 GtCO2e annually from 2020 to 2050 at cost-effective rates. However, current efforts are lacking. In 2019, CO2 emissions from land-use changes made up approximately 11% of global GHG emissions. Halting deforestation, peatland degradation, and mangrove loss are essential for climate action, given these ecosystems hold over 1,020 gigatonnes of carbon. Once disrupted, the carbon released from these ecosystems is challenging to reclaim. Recent trends show more discouraging progress: deforestation across an area larger than Norway occurred between 2015-2021, with significant losses in carbon-rich primary forests. Mangrove losses are also on the rise, while peatlands in Southeast Asia are being drained for agriculture. Large-scale commodity production, driven by demand from wealthier nations, is a significant deforestation contributor. A collaborative approach, involving governments, financial institutions, companies, and civil society, is needed. To dive into our current state and goals I highly recommend this explainer: As we've explored in this series so far, solutions span from reshaping our food systems, to actively removing and offsetting carbon emissions, and protecting the natural carbon sinks of our world. What's clear is that no single effort is enough on its own; we must approach this with a holistic mindset. Tomorrow in the last part of this series we will look at Water, Power and Transportation.

To dive into our current state and goals I highly recommend this explainer: As we've explored in this series so far, solutions span from reshaping our food systems, to actively removing and offsetting carbon emissions, and protecting the natural carbon sinks of our world. What's clear is that no single effort is enough on its own; we must approach this with a holistic mindset. Tomorrow in the last part of this series we will look at Water, Power and Transportation.

Welcome to Part 2 of our series where we dive into solution maps across 12 areas, ranging from Industry to Transportation. If you missed it, Part 1 offers insights into our solutions map for the Industry, Built Environment, and Workforce sectors. For each map, I've provided a concise overview, targeting around 200 words for brevity. Today we dive into the Circular Economy, Finance, Software-first. Let’s dive in 🌊 Click/tap to enlarge Circular Economy The circular economy is a framework for sustainable production and consumption. Unlike our current linear model, where we extract resources, create products, and eventually discard them, the circular economy aims to eliminate waste altogether. It emphasizes sharing, leasing, reusing, repairing, refurbishing, and recycling to extend the life and utility of materials and products. By 2050, adopting circular strategies in sectors like cement, aluminum, steel, plastics, and food could curtail 9.3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent—equivalent to today's total transportation emissions. We have a long way to go: the ""Circularity Gap Report"" reveals a mere 8.6% of global resources are currently reused. The circular economy rests on three pillars: Rethink : Adopt low-carbon and carbon-negative materials for better product designs. By 2030, such initiatives could reduce Europe's CO2 emissions by 48% compared to 2012 levels. Reduce : Prioritize reusing and returning packaging, and promote consumer behaviors like repairing, renting, and buying second-hand items. The European Commission foresees a potential 10% waste reduction by 2030 through these efforts. Recycle : Efficiently track and handle discarded materials and embrace advanced recycling techniques. A holistic recycling strategy could result in annual material savings of up to $1 trillion in sectors like electronics by 2025 Click/Tap to enlarge Finance Climate finance focuses on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, bolstering sinks, and enhancing resilience to climate change impacts. But how much do we actually need to spend? The International Energy Agency's (IEA) 2011 report projects a need for $16.9 trillion in power generation investments through 2035, with 60% directed to renewable energy. The average yearly capital to meet energy demands through 2030 stands at $1.1 trillion, split between emerging economies and other developing countries. Over the next 15 years, an estimated $90 trillion will be necessary for new infrastructure, predominantly in developing nations. To limit global temperature increases to below 2°C by 2100, the IEA forecasts an annual $3.5 trillion energy sector investment until 2050. A 2023 meta-analysis reveals the EU's urgent investment shifts for climate-critical infrastructure until 2035, particularly in power plants and grids, requiring ~87€ billion more than near-term (2021–25) planned budgets. Financing all of this involves diverse strategies, from Climate Angels to VCs and Debt funds. Consumers can contribute through Impact Investing, while the insurance landscape, altered already by climate change, is also evolving rapidly. Click/tap to enlarge Software-First Marc Andreessen's assertion, ""Software is eating the world,"" is at this point a reality of our times. From changing the way businesses operate to reshaping our daily lives, software's omnipresence is hard to overlook. Every climate solution, be it in Energy or Food & Ag, now has an embedded software layer. Glancing through our overviews of solutions, we can find software enhancing the efficiency of wind turbines, diligently tracking food waste, and countless other applications. In this overview I focus on software-first approaches however, categorized into three main segments: Climate Intelligence: This encompasses tools that focus on aspects like ESG ratings, sophisticated climate modeling, and insights into earth systems. Enterprise Software: Provide businesses with a clear understanding of their carbon emissions via carbon accounting, aid in strategizing towards a net-zero scenario, and facilitate the management of offsets and associated emissions. Consumer-Facing Software: This segment includes platforms related to billing, sustainable investing, and applications aimed at assisting individuals in understanding, mitigating, and reducing their personal carbon footprints. From championing sustainable consumption patterns and understanding the vast financial commitments required for climate resilience, to the pivotal role of software in both enterprise and consumer, the road to net-zero is complex but navigable. Next time we dive into Carbon Removal, Food & Ag and Protecting Nature.

We are sharing our current solution maps for 12 areas, from Industry to Transportation. For each map, I also wrote a short overview, aiming for approximately 200 words to keep it brief. Today we start with Industry, the Built Environment and the Workforce. Let’s dive in 🌊 Click/Tap on the Overview to zoom in Industry First up: Industry. Since 2000, GHG emissions from the industrial sector, including the production of goods like cement and steel and infrastructure construction, have surged faster than any other area we are tracking. While energy efficiency improvements have historically reduced emission intensity, increased demand for industrial products is now negating these gains. Alarmingly, global steel production's carbon intensity is worsening, largely due to China's blast furnace-based production. The carbon intensity of cement, another high emitter, is far from meeting the 1.5°C-aligned 2030 goals. A swift rollout of low-carbon steel, cement plants, and alternative cement solutions is essential. Marginal changes won't achieve decarbonization; what's needed is a significant boost in efficiency, widespread electrification of industrial processes, and zero-carbon tech for emissions-heavy industries. Hydrogen is one of the big solutions in Industry, replacing fossil fuels in a lot of ways, but we need a lot of progress and innovation across Production, Transportation, Storage and Enduse. Examining the mineral & material side, it's imperative that we source the essential minerals for this new industry through better methods—embracing automation and modernizing by electrifying our equipment. As batteries are pivotal for electrification, the metals they require should be derived from more sustainable and efficient mining practices. Click/Tap on the Overview to zoom in Built Environment The transition to energy-efficient and electrified buildings is progressing at a sluggish pace. Main GHG emissions from buildings arise from energy usage in various functions like heating, cooling, and lighting. Despite a decline in the energy intensity of building operations in the 2000s and early 2010s, recent progress is inadequate to meet the 1.5°C-aligned 2030 goals. Demand for electricity is surging, erasing previous efficiency gains. Hotter summers increase the demand for cooling, further escalating energy consumption. Colder winters need heat pumps, an acquisition most households can only chose to do every decade or more. Additionally, the yearly 2% growth in building floor area is amplifying CO2 emissions, despite efforts to improve carbon intensity. A significant issue is that most new constructions aren't zero-carbon buildings that utilize high energy efficiency, electric amenities, or on-site renewables. For a sustainable transition, not only should new buildings be designed to this standard, but existing ones must also be retrofitted accordingly. Presently, the rate of deep retrofitting is below 1% annually. The IEA emphasizes that this rate must soar to 2.5-3.5% yearly by the decade's end. So, in summary: Current residential buildings must improve energy efficiency seven times faster, and commercial ones five times faster, within this decade. Workforce The urgency of addressing the climate crisis demands unprecedented scaling in the workforce. While the software industry took 40 years to reach 25M employees, the climate sector needs to mobilize a workforce of 250M within 7-10 years, a feat unparalleled in any industry's history. We need to build the climate workforce an order of magnitude faster than any industry in history has built a workforce. Imagine the multitude of sectors urgently needing professionals for climate-centric roles: In Technology , specialists in engineering, design, and programming are paramount. Operations will demand experts to manage facilities, streamline supply chains, and optimize logistics. The Revenue sector requires strategists to drive sales, shape product launches, and craft pricing models for scalability. Finance looks for adept handlers of company assets and those who can predict future product economics. Lastly, in Policy and Regulatory , there's a pressing need for individuals who can adeptly navigate governmental regulations and align with policy-driven corporate goals. There's a clear lack of workers in all mentioned sectors. To address this, we must focus on three actions: Recruit, Train, and Engage. The best climate workforce already resides within a company. Every individual can contribute to steering their company towards achieving a Net Zero status. This initiative can be grassroots, driven by self-organization, or directed from leadership, focused on engagement. To sum up, the urgency of the climate crisis requires us to rethink and restructure multiple sectors, from industrial practices to building designs to workforce training. The time for incremental changes is over; what we need is transformative action and rethinking entire sectors. Thankfully we have solutions - not only mapped out - but in various phases of scaling. We need to double down on them and accelerate them.

Climate Drift,Scaling Up for the Carbon Challenge: Going from Micro to Massive,A guest post by Isabelle Le Guay,"Welcome back to Climate Drift - a place where you can explore climate solutions and your part to play in the push toward net zero. We’re so glad you’re here! If you are not a regular yet, consider subscribing down below: Subscribe Hi there! 👋 Skander here. This post will continue to explore Carbon Removal. After deep diving into the , digging into , Climate Drift will now look at the carbon removal challenge ahead of us. We hear about carbon dioxide emissions, carbon tons, and huge efforts ahead. But where are we now, and where do we need to go? Cheers to another guest post! Isabelle Le Guay is an operations management consultant who dipped her toes into the Circular Economy and loved seeing how people came together for something bigger than themselves. Find her on ! Recap on scopes 1, 2 and 3 emissions Scopes 1, 2 and 3 emissions encapsulate the totality of a company’s Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG) as a result of its operations. Measuring those emissions enables companies to calculate their climate footprint and can support the development of a decarbonization roadmap. Here is a reminder of what each scope relates to: Scope 1 emissions: these emissions directly result of operations undertaken by an organization. Think manufacturing operations (process), leaks (fugitive), heating of fuels at facility (stationary combustion), gas emitted from car fleets (mobile combustion). However, as companies switch to EVs, the latter category will switch to scope 2. Scope 2 emissions: these correspond to indirect emissions as a result of using third-party utility providers (e.g. to support heating and cooling). Scope 3 emissions: these include all other emissions and are typically part of an organization’s upstream and downstream value chains. Third parties generate and control scope 3 emissions, which makes them comparatively more complex to measure. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol) established . Below is a view from 2021 for the European Union ( ): Putting the order of magnitude into perspective How much carbon is in a ton? Emissions are commonly measured in metric ton carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e). But what exactly does a metric ton mean on an individual level? Climate Drift created a visual with various orders of magnitude. Here’s an extracted view: The below highlights net flows of industry emissions along with CO2 storage potentials. Net zero = Carbon reduction + carbon removal The world emitted , including , in 2021. The strategy to reach net zero will require a combination of energy efficiency, electrification, and decarbonization. But that will not be enough, and the market is still working on solutions for hard-to-decarbonize industries, including the steel or cement industries. The bottom line is that the world cannot reach net zero without Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR). In fact, we are on a trajectory to reach 2 degrees. It is currently estimated that in support of net zero efforts. This represents approximately 25% of annual global carbon emissions. The CDR industry: a nascent industry with a lot on its shoulders Current supply - 110 ktCO2 was delivered
Current demand - The marketplace committed to purchasing 4.8 MtCO2 Sources: , Technologies are slowly maturing There are a multitude of promising CDR technologies at various Technology Readiness Levels (TRL), with wide-ranging cost per ton and learning rates. The most advanced technologies are Bionergy with Carbon Removal and Storage (BiCRS) and Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage (DACCS). To date, DACCS plants have been built globally, and have been commissioned. Combined, these technologies have delivered 2.3% of the committed purchases (see updated values ). The work is not over yet! CDR faces a funding challenge - CDR needs capital to scale quickly - The CDR industry is in a bit of a Catch-22 scenario because it requires funding to advance its R&D efforts at pace but can't attract investors until it shows definite progress. The more projects CDR companies have under their belt, the faster they will be able to drive their technologies to a commercially viable stage. - The market remains voluntary - The market is driven by a host of platforms and players, including buyers clubs (e.g., Frontier), MRV and marketplaces (e.g., Carbonfuture), brokers, and registries (e.g., Puro). This Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM) represents 0.05% of the annual 10 GtCO2 we need to remove. Clearly, we are nowhere near where we need to be. Given the current price per ton, which stands at as of July 2023, only a handful of sectors, including tech, banking, and airline companies, decided to participate in this somewhat philanthropic market. - Government support is coming through - Governments have started to take action in various ways. In the US, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) demonstrate the country's commitment to advancing the CDR industry, starting with Direct Air Capture (DAC): IIJA towards CDR and unlocked a to fund the development of two large DAC demonstration plants in Louisiana and Texas. These two projects will deliver 2 MtCO2, the equivalent emissions of 445,000 gas-powered Citroen C1s. The IRA created the 45Q tax instrument, which offers $180/tCO2 and will help narrow the gap between actual costs and market expectations. Private and public investment will help the US CDR sector reach commercial viability. The US clearly stands out as the most active supporter of CDR; however, countries such as the UK, the EU, Canada, and Japan are also developing a range of solutions, from tax credits to regulation and funding. The sector has a golden opportunity to reflect and build an equitable sector The inherent novelty of this sector gives it a special opportunity to ensure a fair and equitable transition. In particular, the government funding for the Louisiana DAC plant is focused on engaging with local communities that have historically suffered from marginalization and discrimination. This signals a clear intention to build better and could serve as a model for engaging with future communities and ensuring that . CDR has a long path ahead There is no clear consensus within the scientific community The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimated the carbon removal requirements to sit between 100 and 1,000 GtCO2, while the IEA’s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE2050) had a lower estimate of 50-100 GtCO2 by 2050. In any case, the effort required to meet the lowest 2050 target is colossal and has never been achieved at such a pace. As a side note, the CDR industry seems to be laser-focused on removing carbon dioxide emissions, sidelining non-CO2 GHGs. Following this line of thinking, this assumes that all such GHGs will be removed through decarbonization. It is unclear whether and what pathways have been mapped for those GHGs. What targets are we working towards? The market seems to be working towards the NZE scenario, which operates under the assumption that both the energy and industrial processes sectors will achieve net zero by 2050. Global carbon removal potential by 2030 and 2050 under a net zero emissions scenario NZE 2030 target: 75 MtCO2
-Estimated supply - ~33 MtCO2 based on project announcements to date
Estimated demand - 40-200 MtCO2 - The 2030 target - The current decade will be pivotal for the CDR industry. Both the infrastructure and the market will need to scale significantly to meet the requirements set under NZE2050. The IEA estimates that the in theory if all 130 plants currently in the planning stage went online. - The 2050 target - The CDR industry’s mission will be to remove 10 GtCO2 from the atmosphere by 2050. Let’s look at the scale of what we need to build. CarbonCapture is deploying the world's largest direct air capture (DAC) project, Project Bison in Wyoming, with the potential to remove up to 5 million metric tons of CO2 per year. This deeply modular solution is expected to take roughly 7 years to build and will be fully operational by 2030. To reach net zero by 2050 using DAC alone, we would need to build 2,000 plants, and demand would need to increase by a factor of 130 from 2030 levels. Some high-level roadblocks remain - The cost per ton remains prohibitive - Each technology has a different price point. However, all estimates are based on the assumption that the cost will come down to $100/tCO2 or less. BiCRS ranges between $50 and $500/tCO2 based on the CO2 source; DAC remains costly due to energy inefficiencies; and other technologies such as Enhanced Rock Weathering (ERW) and marine CDR (mCDR) are currently in an early stage of development ( ). - Trust - How do companies know whether they got what they paid for? By solving this, Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) solutions will build trust and facilitate the trade of high-quality carbon credits. No standard is surfacing at this date. - Voluntary vs. Compliance market - The BCG confirmed it recently: a compliance market will markedly improve the uptake of carbon removal across high, mid, low scenarii. The sooner and more countries mandate carbon removal, the better our chances of success of achieving the 130-fold increase in demand that is required. - Walk the talk - The government needs to start procuring carbon removal for its own emissions. In doing so, it will create a larger market, providing opportunities for CDR companies to iterate on their technologies. - The government needs to play a bigger role - Building an infrastructure-heavy sector from scratch quickly requires robust and coordinated policy planning. A holistic approach that engages all stakeholders is essential to optimize policy action and achieve this ambitious goal. Tough choices will need to be made. - Will fossil fuel companies be a help or a hindrance? - Oil and gas (O&G) companies are acquiring carbon capture and removal (CDR) startups, of which Carbon Engineering's recent acquisition by Oxy is the latest example. While O&G companies have a unique opportunity to advance CDR, it is important to consider their motivations. Given that large players can drive change more effectively, the O&G industry could play an important role in this transition. However, this will only happen if their intentions are sincere and not simply to maintain their social license to operate. In summary, we are currently looking at a market that will grow exponentially to remove a quarter of our emissions production and help meet the 2050 net zero objective. What will happen after that? Well, we haven’t even talked about legacy emissions. These emissions that we have continuously added to the atmosphere since the industrial revolution add up to and have .

Around the world, people are coming together to engage in the fight against climate change, launching countlessÉ","Climate tech has a marketing problem. Around the world, people are coming together to engage in the fight against climate change, launching countless startups with innovative solutions and cutting-edge tech… …At the same time, many of them are severely struggling to communicate what they actually do . From solar to ag tech, electrification to finance, climate organizations are as clear as mud when telling their story and communicating company value. I’m a marketer with 7+ years of experience helping companies clarify their brand and product messaging. Over the past several months, I’ve visited hundreds of climate tech websites and spent five to ten minutes browsing around trying to learn more about them. Nine times out of ten, I literally could not articulate what they do. This is a problem, and it’s costing otherwise excellent companies potential customers, investors, press, and employees. Example 1: Octopus Energy Let’s take a look at the header section of Octopus Energy’s homepage: While they do a nice job with a clear call to action, I have no idea what I’d be getting a quote for . The header text doesn’t really tell me anything, and while the awards are impressive, all they communicate is that Octopus Energy is good at…supplying energy? My main rule for website messaging is that unless you’re an established global brand like Nike, Apple, or McDonalds, you need to assume that every visitor who comes to your site knows absolutely nothing about your company. It’s your job to clearly explain what you do within the first five to ten seconds of the homepage loading. Example 2: Aurora Solar We can also take a look at the hero section of Aurora Solar’s website. Instead of having one clear message about their product offering, they have a carousel with six slides and six offerings. The slides automatically scroll every five seconds, ensuring that nobody will have enough time to read and take action on any of them. To be clear, I’m a fan of both Aurora Solar and Octopus Energy, but it’s only because I’ve put forth the effort to research them and understand the value they bring to the table. Most potential customers, investors, and employees aren’t going to do that. The “if we build it they will come” mindset doesn’t work. If people can’t quickly understand what you do, you’ll be passed over in favor of better communicators. People don’t buy the best products – they buy the products they can understand the fastest. Climate tech and sustainability initiatives need to rapidly scale, both in marketplace adoption and size of the workforce. Better messaging can be the secret sauce to help make that happen. How to Fix your Messaging If you’re a founder or climate marketer reading this and thinking, “but what we do is complicated,” or, “we do several different things, so it’s hard to create a simple message,” I get it. It’s called the Curse of Knowledge, which occurs when you know so many details about your organization that it becomes difficult to imagine what it’s like not to know. I dealt with it for years as a startup cofounder. But you need to dumb it down. Simplify and clarify your top-level messaging more than you think is necessary. You’ll always have room to get into the details later. Here are 3 key questions your brand messaging should answer. They can help you get started rethinking your pitch decks, website copy, and more. What exactly are you offering? Who’s it for? How will it benefit them? Here’s What Octopus and Aurora Solar Should Put on Their Homepages I spent a few minutes in Photoshop reworking the header areas of Octopus Energy and Aurora Solar’s websites using this principle. Here’s what I came up with: Octopus Energy uses new technology and customer-friendly policies to eliminate the choice between green energy and low prices. Now their header shows potential customers that they can have their cake and eat it, too. Aurora Solar knows that the process of selling residential and commercial solar can be complex. That’s why their product synthesizes every phase of the operation into one software platform that makes it much easier for solar installers to close deals with potential customers. Once you begin to articulate the value your company creates, people will be able to mentally categorize you as a potentially useful entity in their lives. This will make it much easier for them to take the next step with your organization, whether that’s scheduling a demo, signing up for your email list, or applying for a job. We are working on published Part 2 of this series: .

Climate Drift,A guide to Virtual Power Plants (VPP),And how they might be able to replace fossil fuel plants,"Welcome to Climate Drift - the place where we explain climate solutions and how to find your role in the race to net zero. If you haven’t subscribed, join here: Subscribe Hi there! 👋 Skander here. Today we will feature a guest post by Clint: A guide to Virtual Power Plants (VPP). We already had some requests to dive into the space, and are glad to have found the perfect guide for VPP. Clint is a climate-focused product manager in the making. He spend 4+ years building products and recently committed to dedicating his career to the green energy transition. You can connect with him . Let’s dive in 🌊 Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) are seen by the and other federal regulators as an important tool in both driving and meeting the demands of the green energy transition. In fact by 2050, the (RMI) estimates that VPPs could avoid 44 million– 59 million tons of CO2 in 2050 and provide tens of GW of renewable energy capacity by 2050. So what are they? In today’s piece our “Guide to Virtual Power Plants” (VPPs) we will cover four key areas: What are VPPs and what are the types? Why are VPPs important now? Why are VPPs important to climate change? Opportunities and Challenges for VPPs What are VPPs a nd what are the types? Source: RMI In short, a VPP is a portfolio of actively controlled distributed energy resources (DERs) that are pooled together and optimized to provide benefits to the power system, consumers, and the environment. At its core, a VPP is about coordinating the reducing or shifting of energy demand, generating power, or drawing from existing energy storage, based on the needs of the grid. A VPP can therefore be useful in a number of scenarios: If energy demand is too high: When energy demand on the grid is high (e.g. the middle of the day in summer when ACs are blasting), VPPs can coordinate with DERs like heat pumps, thermostats, or EV chargers to reduce demand or run on a more efficient setting to reduce strain on the grid. Alternatively, the VPP can also discharge stored energy from batteries or solar panels to meet the demand. Owners of these assets can be rewarded for this contribution. If renewable energy production is too high: Alternatively if renewable energy production is high (e.g. a sunny day in California where there are lots of solar farms) the VPP can reduce the output from renewable sources such as residential solar or utility-scale wind or funnel this load toward energy storage systems such as batteries to be used at a later point. It can also ensure that DERs like EV chargers are making the most out of this high sunshine to charge cars. If running on renewable energy is desired: Similarly, if a business or household wants to run solely on renewable energy to stay green or reduce cost, a VPP can ensure that DERs and batteries make use of this load when it is abundant, and stop drawing from the grid in the evening when fossil fuel energy is prevalent. VPPs are made of 3 components: DERs : Each VPP is composed of hundreds or thousands of DERs (distributed energy resources) located near homes or businesses. These “devices” include solar panels, EVs, electric panels, smart thermostats, batteries, etc. Aggregation : The whole point of a VPP is to pool these DERs together and control them in an orchestrated way. This orchestration is normally done using software and IoT devices. They can be controlled by a VPP provider or utility (more on this). Grid Integrated: VPPs are still part of a grid (as opposed to microgrids) and rely on many of the same transmission and distribution lines. As a result VPPs leverage “demand flexibility” (the ability for devices to stop consuming energy when renewables supply is low) to draw power or store power when the energy is cheapest or greenest. For households and businesses that own DERs (e.g. an electric vehicle fleet) participating in a VPP isn’t just a way of potentially consuming more green energy, or saving money, but an opportunity to earn incentives by selling energy back to the wholesale market when demand surpasses supply. There are two broad types of VPPs Market-participating VPPs, and Retail VPPs Source: RMI Market-participating VPPs: These VPPs services to and wholesale electricity markets (RTO or ISO) and are paid for the electricity generated or load shifted. VPPs are run by private companies but the market demand is created and signaled by the wholesale grid operator (which covers about two-thirds of the US). Example : OhmConnect has been operating a market-participant VPP in California’s wholesale electricity market run by CAISO (California’s transmission and “grid” operator) with more than 200k members and 250k dispatchable smart devices. During a heatwave in September of 2022 CAISO called on available resources to match market demand from VPPs managed by OhmConnect, Tesla, Sunrun, and AutoGrid to name a few. Over 9 days OhmConnect dispatched member devices 1.3m times to CAISO and CAISO paid OhmConnect for services who in turn paid $2.7m to its members. The National Grid “ConnectedSolutions” mobile app showing earnings for VPP members Retail VPPs: Provide services to and are compensated by utilities. Utility customers sign up to the VPP program run by the utility and give the utility access to coordinate their DERs. Utilities may also partner with 3rd party service providers to manage the program and/or software Example : National Grid (utility serving customers in New York and Massachusetts) runs the ConnectedSolutions VPP program and pays customers upfront and annual incentives to enroll smart thermostats, home batteries and EVs in their VPP. In 2020 the VPP and its enrolled devices helped reduce summer peak demand by 0.9% (Image showing the ConnectedSolutions app for members with total savings to-date shown) Why are VPPs important now? In truth solar panels, batteries and even VPPs have existed for decades (formerly known as demand response programs) however they are becoming increasingly popular for 6 key reasons which will see DER ownership grow across the US and globally in the next decade and make VPPs more viable: Reason 1: FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) Order 2222 which was signed in 2020 and is working to open wholesale energy markets across the US to VPPs. Up until the signing of this order, the 7 regional grids (ISOs and RTOs) did not universally allow DERs to access the wholesale energy market and the decision to do so was up to each region. Order 2222 meant that all regional grids must now allow DERs to participate. This opens the door for DER aggregators to generate, buy, and sell electricity in these grids. Reason 2: The pressing need to accelerate the decarbonisation of energy. Reason 3: Lowering costs for DER devices making them more commonplace in homes and businesses. The cost of solar panels, batteries, and EVs are declining whilst reliability increases. Reason 4: More DER manufacturers and supplies leading to products and configurations to suit differing needs. EV manufacturers are a good example of this with car companies now offering EVs of different body types, range, and consumer taste. Reason 5: Tech advancements in algorithms to aggregate and coordinate demand flexibility and coordinate supply discharging. , for example is a UK-based company pioneering V2G (vehicle to grid) technology to leverage an EV’s battery for more efficient energy supply and use. Reason 6: for VPP participation and DER ownership. Solar panels and battery systems have become more commonplace in places like California. Image Source: Unsplash In light of this DERs are expected to explode over the next decade with the predicting the following by 2030: Homes with Smart Thermostats grow from 10% in 2023 to 34% in 2030 Resi Rooftop Solar capacity from 27GW to 83GW in 2030 Light Electric Vehicles from 3m to 26m in 2030 10 reasons why VPPs are important to climate change There are many reasons that VPPs are beneficial to climate change mitigation with the main reasons being: VPPs decarbonise energy supply: Because VPPs can shift energy demand away from when the grid relies on highly polluting coal and gas-fired plants, they can allow homes and businesses to run on more renewable energy. . VPPs help manage increasing electricity demand : As more DERs come online such as heat pumps and EVs, VPPs can both add renewable generated capacity as well as shift load and improve demand flexibility to prevent overloading the grid. Health and equity improvements: Reduce reliance on gas-fired peaker plants and the health risks this poses due to pollution. Low-income households can also benefit from additional revenue and cost-reduction from VPPs. Increasing the viability and reliability of virtual power plants could mean that natural gas generation plants like this one in Wilmington (greater Los Angeles) are taken offline faster. This could have positive health outcomes for local communities. Image Source: LA Times. Other ways that VPPs help society (optional section): Grid Reliability and Resilience : Overtime VPPs have proven and continue to prove that they can show up on days and hours when the grid needs them to supply critical energy or shift demand. Example: South Australia’s VPP stabilized the grid in October 2019 when a coal-fired plant went offline and left a supply gap of 748MW. Affordability : The price of electricity is projected to increase year on year (as well as energy consumption globally). VPPs can make electricity more affordable by compensating homes and businesses with DER assets. Incentivise Renewable Development : Increased renewables development due to increasing capacity factor of wind and solar leading to overall higher utilization and more investment in renewable energy whilst accelerating the closure of fossil-fuel power plants. Electrification : VPPs incentivize more DER devices to be brought into the economy incentivising more storage and the electrification of items that previously ran on fossil fuels (e.g. cars and buses). More electrified devices also mean fewer bottlenecks in transmission or generation due to flexible demand. Reduce Grid Investment: Scaling VPP programs avoid or defer timely and costly energy generation capacity developments (e.g. new peaker power plants) or transmission and distribution infrastructure for utilities and grid operators. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL) electrification futures study found that demand flexibility could avoid or defer $120 billion worth of generation capacity investments through 2050. Faster Renewable Deployment : Because VPPs rely on modular DER devices that can be bought and installed by any business or home they are not necessarily blocked by transmission infrastructure and interconnection delays. Better Demand Forecasting: Coupled with software VPPs can provide stronger behind-the-meter data and intelligence about consumer uses and behaviors around heat pumps or EVs. This leads to better future demand forecasting and better products from OEMs Opportunities and Or Challenges for VPPs A map showing the 7 major RTOs and ISOs in the US. Source: RMI However, like all climate technology innovations, VPPs are not without their challenges. There are 3 main barriers to further adoption. Wholesale market barriers As mentioned earlier, FERC Order 2222 in 2020 required regional transmission organizations and independent system operators (ISOs) (essentially grid operators) to allow VPPs to participate alongside traditional utilities in wholesale energy markets. However VPPs are still reliant on RTOs and ISOs (the regional grids) to ensure a smooth transition including setting up metering requirements, interconnection, and customer data access before they can actively participate. The Order itself is still being debated amongst regulators and industry and advocates of VPPs have argued that the draft plans released so far by the FERC would place too many limits on how DERs can participate in wholesale energy markets. Utilities and state regulators, however, worry that letting DERs participate in wholesale markets openly will wreak havoc on transmission and distribution lines. The fact remains that there are plenty of regulatory hurdles. For one, many states are still used to operating under 1 utility without a wholesale energy market. Learning to adapt state regulations to suit VPPs that cross state-boundaries will be hard. Even where a wholesale market exists, the regulatory frameworks and grids were initially designed to support a handful of large power plants, not 1000s of devices with different functions and operating systems. For more on this, “The Grid” by Gretchen Bakke provides a great breakdown on the history and challenges facing the US grid. Retail utility offerings Where wholesale markets don’t exist (about 1/3 of the US) retail programs run by utilities are the only option for customers. Even where wholesale markets exist, utilities (due to their large customer base) will still be major VPP players and be expected to drive these programs. However, there is clearly a conflict of interest between VPPs and utilities with utilities naturally being wary that VPPs will make utilities increasingly irrelevant. Utility operators may not trust VPPs to show up and supply critical services. Utilities are also financially incentivised by regulatory models to make capital investments into things like power plants that do not provide demand-side solutions. VPPs also cut across regions with different state and federal regulatory bodies and this leads to complex coordination. Consumer and policymaker awareness State and Federal policymakers have a large role to play to help drive VPP adoption. Image Source: Unsplash Finally, as with all things renewables, VPP awareness remains low. VPP technology and service providers need to spend significant time and resources educating customers. Although consumers stand to gain from participating in VPPs, the current gains are still only in the 100s or 1000s of dollars across a year, a saving that is often not big enough to create real consumer behaviourial change. Elected officials are also often in the dark and need to be educated to create advantageous policies. Closing Thoughts: What’s next for VPPs? It’s clear that VPPs are still taking their first steps but are quickly learning to run. The DOE and other federal agencies like the FERC will continue to help DERs play a bigger role in the US’s future energy mix - the IRA will help catalyse this further still! As climate change continues as an existential threat, and renewable electricity and the devices that generate them become cheaper and more widely used, it won’t before fossil fuel power plants become phased out and each suburb or city becomes its own self-sustaining “virtual power plant”.

Climate Drift,The Rise of Climate Tech Accelerators,The Next Generation of Accelerators,"Dive into Climate Drift – your guide to understanding climate solutions and uncovering your place in the net zero movement. If you're not yet a part, you can subscribing here: Subscribe Hey there 👋 Skander here. We are continuing on our theme of accelerating climate tech. Last time we looked into venture builders, companies building companies: Today we are looking at accelerators. Again I want to spotlight two: - Third Derivative: From Research to Acceleration - Elemental Excelerator: A non-profit approach to Acceleration Let’s dive in 🌊 First: What even is an accelerator? Startup accelerators are structured programs that offer early-stage companies a combination of seed investment, mentorship, and training in exchange for equity in the company. The primary goal is to help startups validate their business models, refine their pitches, and rapidly grow their business in a short amount of time, often 3-4 months. The core idea is thus: accelerate the trajectory a startup is already on. Startups apply to join these programs, and if accepted, they're immersed in an intense period of learning and execution. At the end of the program, they typically pitch to a room full of investors on ""Demo Day"" to secure further funding. The best known startup accelerator is probably Y Combinator. Founded in 2005, YC has incubated many successful companies, including Dropbox, Airbnb, and Stripe. YC provides startups with funding ($125,000 in exchange for 7% equity & $375,000 uncapped on top), guidance from seasoned entrepreneurs, and a vast network of alumni and resources. The value of YC goes beyond its initial seed money; the reputation, mentorship, and network they offer can be pivotal for a startup's success. Why do we need dedicated Climate Tech accelerators? Although YC accepts climate startups - out of the >4000 they invested in , and even has a , there are some good reasons why dedicated climate accelerators make sense: - Market Challenges: Software companies are often entering a blue ocean: A new land to explore, without large incumbents. Climate tech often enter and try to disrupt existing markets, with large players that need to be worked with (think utilities) and regulations to be understood. Accelerators assist startups in refining their market approach, ensuring a fit for their innovations, and building the necessary connections to drive adoption. - Specialized Expertise and Resources: Climate tech combines varied disciplines like energy, biology, and technology. Dedicated accelerators can offer the specific mentorship, tools, and expertise tailored to these unique intersections, which general accelerators might lack. - Long Development Cycles: Climate solutions may take longer to develop and commercialize than, say, a software app. Accelerators can provide sustained support and resources during these long cycles and the 4 valleys of death. Next we will take a look at 2 accelerators: Third Derivative Third Derivative (D3) is a pioneering initiative aimed at accelerating climate innovation on a global scale. Established in December 2020 by RMI and New Energy Nexus, D3 emerged as a response to the uneven distribution of funding and resources in the climate tech sector. Recognizing that access often depends on networks, D3 seeks to level the playing field by connecting climate tech entrepreneurs to a vast ecosystem of experts, investors, and corporate partners. RMI (Rocky Mountain Institute), co-founded by Amory Lovins, is a U.S.-based organization dedicated to research, publication, consulting, and lecturing in the realm of sustainability. Established in 1982, its primary focus is on uncovering profitable innovations for energy and resource efficiency. Since its inception, RMI has expanded significantly, with over 550 staff and an annual budget exceeding $120 million. The organization's approach is non-adversarial and independent, placing a strong emphasis on market-based solutions to drive sustainable change. With a network that has corporate partners with a market cap of $4T, $8B AUM of investor partners spread across five continents, and over 150 startups, D3 is aiming to bridge finance and resource gaps to accelerate market entry. Their accelerator program boasts flexibility and customization: Cohorts typically follow specific themes, such as DAC or SAF. The program spans 18 months. Startups chosen for the accelerator are offered an optional $100k convertible note. The program is crafted to align a startup's current growth phase, providing tailored programming to suit their needs: either hand-off or hands-on. I'd also like to highlight that their collaborative research with RMI is exceptional. While it might require a bit of digging to locate, it's undoubtedly worth it: Elemental Excelerator In 2022, Elemental allocated $8 million across 17 climate startups. This year, the organization aims to invest between $350,000 and $1 million in up to 20 ventures, with an additional $30 million earmarked for three to six scale-up projects with tangible greenhouse gas reductions and positive community impacts. In the upcoming five years, their aim is to support 100 climate technology companies. To date, their portfolio boasts over 150 companies, with a $8B in follow-on funding and awards totaling $59.4M granted to these enterprises. Elemental’s interests are about as broad as climate tech itself — spanning electric vehicles, energy storage, recycling tech, cement decarbonization, seaweed cultivation and composting. Elemental addresses two key climate change challenges: community-focused climate tech funding and integrating equity into solutions. Elemental offers two distinct tracks for climate tech companies: The Strategy Track , running 10 months, is geared towards newer ventures, requiring CEOs engage in weekly workshops, coaching, and strategic exercises. This track predominantly supports companies in their early stages, offering both funding ($350K) and a tailored curriculum. Average Stats for Companies Joining: $164K annual revenue. 6 full-time employees. $2.8M total funding raised. 1 commercial pilot project. On the other hand, the Project Track is tailored for more mature, later-stage companies with existing commercial deployments. The focus here is on executing high-impact projects by reducing risks associated with innovation and transformation. Companies in this track receive substantial funding (of $1m) to explore new products, business models, or expansion strategies, all while emphasizing collaborations with community-based partners. Average Stats for Companies Joining: $12.2M total funding raised. $1.1M annual revenue. 19 full-time employees. 2+ commercial deployments. While general accelerators like Y Combinator have proven their mettle, there's an evident need for specialized climate tech accelerators. Third Derivative's global outreach and synergy with RMI harnesses a vast ecosystem, while Elemental Excelerator, with its dual-track approach, showcases adaptability by catering to both emerging and mature startups. Of course, these two are merely the tip of the iceberg, as numerous other accelerators continue to emerge rapidly. Tomorrow we will feature a guest post - a guide to VPPs.

Not on board yet? Sign up here: Subscribe Already a Climate Drift(er)? Pass the knowledge on to a friend, relative, or that cool stranger you just met: Hey there 👋 Skander here. At the heart of Climate Drift's mission is the acceleration of Climate Solutions. We strive to explain these solutions, bridge the gap between investors and startups, and help people shift into climate. We're certainly not alone in this - There are companies trying to accelerate Climate Solutions through various approaches: From accelerators to venture studios, from VC investors to foundations. I spoke to many of them last week and I'd like to shed some light on their work. Today I wanted to spotlight a specific category: The venture studio Out of the venture studios I want to take 2 to dive deeper: - Deep Science Ventures: A deep tech venture studio - Marble: A Climate Tech Venture Studio This is just the tip of the iceberg, and I'll be showcasing different models in the future. For the climate investors among our readers, stay tuned – a spotlight on key players in the climate investment realm is on the horizon. Let’s dive in 🌊 For a startup to survive, let alone succeed, it must navigate many types of risk. In a pivotal essay, Marc Andreessen once said: ""The only thing that matters is getting to product/market fit."" The underlying implication is that most startups fail at reaching product market fit - and indeed it is the most common valley of death. In climate tech we have even more Valleys of Death: 4 to be precise. What is a venture studio? A venture studio is a company dedicated to building new companies. It concentrates on streamlining the startup creation process, ensuring that founders have access to the essential support and resources right from the outset. So: the idea is to make starting these companies as easy as possible, having the highest chance of survival through the valleys of death. Venture studios and venture capital firms share a fundamental similarity in their business models, which is acquiring equity stakes in startups, hoping for an increase in their value. However, this is where the similarities begin and end. Unlike venture capital firms that scout for founders already pursuing an idea, venture studios take a different approach. They often originate promising concepts in-house, driven by comprehensive research, and then seek capable operators to bring these ideas to life. Sometimes they scout, but not founders who already started startups, but researchers who work on tech that might be good fit. This operational approach likens venture studios more to consulting firms, designating ""employees"" specific projects to manage. Such a shift is significant. While traditional venture capital adopts a reactive stance, awaiting deals to come their way, venture studios embrace a more proactive strategy: they create the solutions they are looking for. In climate solutions this might be what we need: The time is running out, the problems are clear, the viable solutions paths are also becoming clearer. Many of these markets aren't monopolistic, allowing room for multiple startups to prosper within a single solution path. Refer to the climate solutions map that highlights 200 distinct paths. Each sector has the potential for one or more venture studios to actively produce solutions. In some ways we are still at the early stages of climate tech. However, several climate venture studios have already emerged. Here are two of the leading venture studios as our case studies this time: Deep Science Ventures Deep Science Ventures (DSV), established in 2016 and headquartered in London, is a deep-tech venture builder. Comprising both a venture studio and an investment fund, DSV has streamlined its approach to science company development and investment. DSV concentrates its efforts on four core sectors: Agriculture, Computation, Climate, and Pharma. Central to their approach is the commitment to foster ventures steered by expert teams. Taking inspiration from ""How Solar Got Cheap"", DSV's strategy in the Climate sector is to reverse engineer solutions by beginning with fundamental human needs like shelter, energy, and food. Their objective is to pinpoint technological combinations that promise high long-term efficiencies coupled with accelerated learning curves. Venture creation at DSV is characterized by its emphasis on shared outcomes. Rather than zeroing in on a solitary idea, technology, or individual, DSV focuses on broader macro perspectives. Around these marco visions they recruit founders equipped with specific skillsets, thereby ensuring that the desired macro changes can be pursued from multiple angles. Founders who collaborate with them are provided with a salary up to 18 months to establish a company. Throughout this period, they receive consistent funding and the support of a dedicated sector-specialist team. These founders engage with opportunities DSV has pre-identified. Additionally, they have the flexibility to form multiple companies during their tenure with DSV, which significantly mitigates the traditional risks associated with founding a startup. What have they achieved so far? DSV has experienced significant growth since its inception, expanding its team to predominantly include deep experts, 95% of whom have PhDs or C-Suite founder backgrounds. Within the past five years, DSV has demonstrated a failure rate of less than 10%, with all failed startups failing in their first year. 77% of associated founders launched their companies successfully and 80% of their portfolio companies secured follow up investments. On an operational level, DSV’s companies have achieved an average of 18 months to TRL4 (Technology Readiness Level 4). A notable success story includes Mission Zero's accomplishment in carbon capture at minimal energy requirements, which subsequently won Elon Musk's X Prize. DSV's forward-looking strategy is robust. They have an extensive pipeline with over 20 partnered domains, which will provide foundational funding for 30 startups in the next three years. Their vision for the next five years includes establishing 100 new companies and opening their toolkit to the wider scientific community - also in collaboration with Climate Drift. Marble Marble stands as Europe's only venture studio with a sole focus on climate solutions, headquartered in Paris, France. The company's primary ambition is the significant reduction of annual greenhouse gas emissions—targeting several gigatons—and laying the groundwork for a climate-resilient future. Recognizing the magnitude of this endeavor, Marble understands the need for multiple strategies only focussed on climate. Marble's approach to climate solutions encompasses a range of solutions. These include Bio-Production, Direct Air Capture along with its Use and Storage, Carbon Mineralisation, and Ocean Carbon Removal. Additionally, they delve into Desert Farming, the sourcing of Critical Minerals essential for the energy transition, Methane Oxidation in regions with low concentrations, novel Biotech methodologies for Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR), and advanced Biomass Processing techniques for both CDR and its subsequent utilisation. The partners at Marble come from a strong tech background: they have been aiding hundreds of pre-company founders, contributing to the inception of over 30 startups spanning domains like AI, biotech, materials, and fusion. Their roles as advisors or angel investors have facilitated capital raises from known venture capitalists, culminating in a value creation surpassing $250 million. Their program is clearer structured like an accelerator/company builder model. This methodology stands in contrast to more traditional programs, which are typically geared towards intellectual property commercialization or accommodating vast cohorts. The strategy has been dubbed as ""reverse tech transfer."" and unfolds over three phases: Phase 1: Explore - Identifying the Optimal Idea in 3 Months In the initial phase, participants will work together to produce and evaluate a range of venture hypotheses. The methodology integrates elements like structured ideation, technical overview, thorough market research, interactions with experts, and a techno-economic assessment. The objective is to systematically narrow down these hypotheses in pursuit of a concept that not only has a notable potential for climate impact but also demonstrates substantial business viability. At the culmination of this stage, an evaluation will be conducted to decide on the viability of advancing to the 'Create' phase, with the intent of forming a startup. During this and the next phase, participants receive a €2,500 monthly stipend. Phase 2: Create - Turn The Idea Into a New Company in 6 months In the ""Create"" phase, the aim is to collaboratively transform the most viable idea into a pre-seed company primed for investment. The primary objectives during this phase include validating the technical approach and market entry strategy, showcasing early customer engagement, defining a roadmap with milestones, and most important: recruiting leading co-founders and advisors. Additionally, in certain instances, an initial prototype might already be in development. Upon the phase's conclusion, participants, alongside their co-founders, will present their progress and vision to the investment committee. Phase 3: Spinout Upon securing approval from the investment committee, participants and their co-founders will spearhead a new startup, with the backing of an initial €250k pre-seed investment. The founding team will retain 80% ownership of the newly established company. While this is the end of the program, the commitment from Marble continues, as they continue to offer support throughout the startup's journey towards securing a seed funding round. Thank you for joining our dive into Venture Studios. Their model, distinct from traditional VC firms, is characterized by proactive involvement in the birth and growth of startups, and might be the perfect fit for Climate Solutions.

Climate Drift,3 Lessons from EuropeÕs largest Climate Tech Conference,Lessons learned at The Drop Conference,"Like many, I initially approached the climate tech sphere with skepticism, despite (or because) my background & experience in the tech. I found myself questioning its genuine potential for impact. Is it merely a realm of unsubstantiated hype? Can it genuinely lead to reduced emissions, or will these innovations simply be “put on the blockchain” and end up gathering dust in a drawer and the write offs of a VC? Over the years, engaging with numerous climate tech founders and delving deep into their solutions has shifted my perspective. There is something more here. My experience at The Drop further solidified my belief. I experienced a thriving ecosystem and movement, genuine individuals and organisations, and solutions that are not just theoretical but making tangible strides forward. While The Drop may be labeled a conference, its vibe is more with that of a retreat. Collaborating in spontaneous groups, consisting of both familiar faces and newfound connections, we debated problems and solutions, shared learnings and frustrations, finding ourselves in conversations that stretched into the night and are still continued in Whatsapp groups, email chains and Linkedin chats. Three observations stand out for me: The main hall of The Drop Learning 1: The climate tech world acts in good faith For an entire day, stakeholders from every facet of the climate landscape met in one (very large) room. Every few minutes, there was an opportunity to delve into a different solution pathway. It's rare to find a venue where, in one moment, you can converse with who helped craft the net-zero strategy for shipping behemoth Maersk (fyi: 10+ methanol-operated ships on order and an ensuing focus on ammonia, while being backward compatible till the alternative fuel supply chain is being built out) and then, in the next conversation, engage with who's spent years constructing automated insect farms. Set in a quaint Swedish city, The Drop provides an atmosphere where serendipitous encounters with fellow attendees become part of the experience. A casual conversation at the bus stand might unexpectedly evolve into an enlightening deep dive on creating a self-checkout library of items—like tools and equipment—right from the living room of a from Iceland. Even something as mundane as grabbing a sandwich can transform into an insightful session on IKEA's strategy for collaborating with circular economy startups, delivered by an . The entire city becomes an extended venue for spontaneous knowledge-sharing. Above all, a defining trait of the climate tech community is its good faith. We're unified by a singular objective, reaching Net Zero, and there's a collective understanding that the challenges we face are complex, multi-dimensional and not easy to solve. This shared vision drives us to openly exchange insights and offer assistance wherever possible. A pre planned discussion round Learning 2: Perspectives give perspective Imagine a circle of people, meeting up for a discussion about how we can create more successful First-of-a-Kind (FOAK) projects. Moderating the conversation is an industry who has not only built multiple FOAKs but is now switched sides from operator to investor: channeling funds dedicated to launching new programs helping companies reach FOAK. Around him founders currently trying to build & finance their own FOAKs, investors of all stages, from early angels to late state growth funds. In between: potential off takers and buyers. Each individual shares their unique perspective in response to questions posed to the group & by the group. Everyone has a voice, free to ask questions and contribute insights. Together these perspectives create a whole, great than the sum of the parts. Certainly, these exchanges can occur online, and I'm grateful to everyone I've connected with so far, and had discussions with & learned from. Yet, there's a magic in spontaneous, face-to-face, real world interactions. When diverse individuals come together, the outcomes are refreshingly unpredictable. Open spaces encourage organic interactions, where people naturally converge, eavesdrop, and subsequently contribute their unique perspectives to conversations. This serendipity breeds wonderful, unexpected outcomes. Unplanned connections arise, leading to uncharted possibilities. New pathways emerge, revealing doors that one hadn't even perceived previously. The power of such in-person exchanges can't be overstated, with their potential to create ripples of change and innovation. Learning 3: Collaborative Creation Out of these connections and conversations grow projects and progress. One idea for example that has been floated between some people at Deep Science Ventures - shoutout to - and us here at Climate Drift is creating an Open Database of KPIs for : It's clear that a consistent standard for TRLs across specific industry verticals is lacking. What one individual perceives as TRL 9, another might view as merely TRL 7. This discrepancy introduces complexities and challenges for startups, investors, and all stakeholders involved. What if there would be clear KPIs for specific products and verticals that define TRL ranges? What if these benchmarks were public, accessible to all, and open for collective input and refinement? The feedback from The Drop was clear: From investors to builders to off-takers, it resonated. Next steps are already in preparation. If you're interested in joining the initiative, feel free to reach out to us at or leave a comment. I've touched on only three lessons and spotlighted a single project from The Drop. I could only mention a friction of the people I met and interactions I had. There are numerous other conversations and projects I intend to discuss and highlight - but for now, my bed calls. One last thing: It was a pleasure meeting so many of our readers from various backgrounds. Thank you to those who approached me, for the generous compliments, invaluable feedback, and conversations. For those that reached out and I couldn’t meet: I will try to be respond to every message and email. This goes also for the promised follow-ups.

Based on industry-funded studies it will neverÉ","Welcome to Climate Drift - the place where we break down climate solutions and how to find your role in the race to net zero. If you haven’t subscribed, join here: Subscribe Hi there! 👋 Skander here. While I am at The Drop we will feature some guest posts by our readers, friends, and family. Starting off will be Christoph, a great engineer & founder, diving into lab-grown meat - and why he doesn’t consider it a climate solution. Follow Chris on . Let’s dive in 🌊 Skander PS: If you want to write a guest post too, just ping us at guest@climatedrift.com Greetings fellow climate drifters 👋, my name is Christoph and I am a software engineer and recovering founder. I am currently studying climate policy and in particular how to improve it with the use of AI. Few topics spark as much controversy in the climate debate as the assertion that we need to cut our meat consumption if we want to reach our climate targets. On some primal level going for the burger on your plate is a much more outrageous act than going for your car. So it’s no surprise that technical-minded people have been looking for a panacea in the form of lab-grown meat. And the pitch is alluring: If the plan works out the burger is safe and we get to reduce our emissions. We get to have our cake and eat it, too. However that “ if ” is doing a lot of work in this sentence. So today we will have a look at the bear take on lab-grown meat: It might be viable at some point but too late and too ineffectual to be considered a Climate Solution. Even worse: It could distract from the real issue much in the same way that CDR (Carbon Dioxide Removal) is already being used by Big Oil to prevent actual mitigation. But before we get there we need to establish why we need to urgently reduce our dependence on livestock farming. We can’t meat two degrees This section is entirely based on the IPCC AR5 report on food security (Chapter 5). The IPCC reports are the authoritative scientific meta-reviews of all things climate. Let us start by ripping off the band-aid: Livestock farming is a major driver in deforestation and methane emissions causing about 15% of human greenhouse gas emissions ( ). This means we need to drastically reduce the emissions from this sector if we want to have a realistic shot at achieving our climate goals. There are a few nuances here to be aware of: Not all meat is created equal. Cattle are a complete outlier, accounting for 65–77% of livestock-based emissions. Even in the absence of climate change, they are pretty inefficient. For example, one study found that “replacing beef in the USA diet with poultry can meet the caloric and protein demands of about 120 to 140 million additional people consuming the average American diet” (IPCC AR5  5.3.4). Not all carnivores are created equal. While most cattle emissions are generated in developing countries, they are not the ones to benefit. Citizens in developed nations consume on average four times as much dairy and three times as much meat than those living in developing nations. This means that not only should richer countries lead the charge on this issue, but it also implies that any meat substitute must be affordable on a global scale. It’s not just the climate. Meat and dairy also exert pressure on increasingly unstable freshwater resources. Beyond that, there are well-known issues regarding health and the ethics of industrial farming. You don’t have to go fully vegan . As you can see in the graph below even moderate reductions can go a long way. With a shift in culture and an increase in substitute products, cutting down on meat has never been easier. However, the cattle industry has taken a page from big oil and is currently waging an against any type of regulation. This is where the argument for lab-grown meat comes into play: We need to get people to switch, but the threshold seems high. So let’s offer them a product that is nearly identical but can be powered by green energy. Can we grow our way out of this? Sofar lab-grown meat has arguably followed the trajectory of many paradigm-shifting technologies: While the first public trial for a single beef patty cost $300,000 in 2013, startups and billions of funding have since managed to wrangle the price below $100. There is no doubt that this is an exciting consumer product backed by a wealth of money, talent, and interest. However, the only question in the climate context is whether or not they can significantly mitigate meat-based emissions within the next ten to twenty years or so. The answer to that question is: No . It is very unlikely that lab-grown meat will achieve anywhere near the economies of scale needed to make a reasonable dent in global meat consumption. According to Joe Fassler who wrote an excellent article on this question in thecounter, the outlook might be even more dire: “Splashy headlines have long overshadowed inconvenient truths about biology and economics. Now, extensive new research suggests the industry may be on a billion-dollar crash course with reality.” - Joe Fassler, thecounter While I highly recommend that you read I will now briefly summarize how he arrived at such an extreme conclusion. It doesn’t scale. One of the chief proponents of lab-grown meat, the Good Food Institute (GFI), commissioned a techno-economic analysis (TEA) to project what the production of cell-cultivated meat in 2030 might look like. They imagine a facility that would use huge bioreactors to produce 10,000 metric tons of meat per year at an upfront capital cost of $450 million. 10,000 metric tons might sound like a lot until you learn that it would only amount to 0.02% of meat production in the US. Further, due to the high capital expenditure, investors would have to lock themself into 30-year repayment terms to keep the price per kilogram competitive - this is why supporters of the technology are calling for substantial public investments. So investors are faced with the “choice” of either throwing away absurd amounts of money to maybe make the tiniest dent in our meat production or to make a profit with a niche luxury product. It might not even work. Even if they get built, these plants might not ever actually end up producing these quantities of meat. While animal cells double at a rate of once every 24 hours, bacteria do so once every 20 minutes. This means that these facilities effectively require a pharma-grade sterile environment to prevent minor contaminations from ruining days and tons worth of cell cultures. The entire pharma industry currently boasts a bioreactor volume three times as large as the facility imagined but composed of much smaller installations. No one knows if it is even possible to do this at the proposed scale and it might not even end up working at all. Or to quote Dr. Humbird the lead author of another industry-funded TEA: “Clearly, I don’t think cultured meat has legs [...] I think I make that clear in the paper, if not in such colloquial terms. But it seems like a bunch of hooey to me.” People might still reject it. The key selling point of lab-grown meat is that it aims to taste just like the real deal, without all the downsides. But taste alone might not be enough to win everyone over. Even if we nail the technical aspects, there's evidence to suggest that a sizeable chunk of people won't make the switch. It turns out that when people don’t reduce their meat consumption they do so for a variety of cultural and economic reasons, taste just being one of them. This is before we even get into legitimate health concerns or the potential of anti-tech social panics such as those that we saw during the pandemic. We already have the tools Okay, so it seems that lab-grown meat has some issues that might prevent it from being a player in the landscape of Climate Tech. But do we have alternatives and if so how are they doing? Yes, we do, but unfortunately, we are not on track to meet our goals. Policy. As with all things climate-related the key lies in pricing in the negative externality which means covering meat and dairy under existing or new carbon pricing schemes. There are however quite a few political challenges here that need to be overcome with carefully crafted policy: Revenues need to be appropriately recycled to consumers so as to not make meat eating a privilege of the rich. Further, agricultural lobbies - which hold a lot of sway in the EU for instance - must be carefully involved in order to prevent them from blocking the process outright. In the meantime, governments might opt for more indirect yet targeted measures such as the upcoming EU Deforestation regulation which flat-out bans products that have caused any form of forest degradation. Soft measures such as awareness campaigns and subsidies for alternatives are also a part of the mix. Market . The good news is that we are already starting to cut down on our livestock emissions. It is just not happening fast enough. While there is both a strong cultural momentum and an explosion of meat substitute products more effort is needed. Stay tuned for an in-depth analysis here at ClimateDrift. To summarize; while the solutions we have are imperfect they completely outmatch lab-grown meat for the simple virtue that we know their issues while the former is full of unknowns. Beyond that, we can already measure the GHG impact of alternatives in megatons of CO2 equivalents which cannot be said for lab-grown meat. It’s not a Climate Solution Now advocates of lab-grown meat will have a few objections to the points I raised earlier which I will address here: We tend to be myopic when it comes to frontier innovation. Just look at the price drop of DNA sequencing or solar panels! As Skander has not every technology is solar panels. In fact, we have also heard this argument being made for crypto, self-driving cars, or going to Mars. Sure they might overpromise for years and some of them might end up changing the world. Once lab-grown meat beats all the odds I will happily attach a clarification to this article. But when it comes to the climate this is a bet we cannot afford to make, especially, in the presence of superior alternatives. It does not have to be this black and white. We can push for dietary changes while still advocating for lab-grown meat. While I agree that progress is not a zero-sum game the same cannot be said for the amount of political willpower and investment available for fighting climate change. Every inch of legislation is currently hard-fought and the resulting public budgets are thus limited. Even worse; governments that are being lobbied by big meat might be tempted into using public investments in lab-grown meat as a way to greenwash their policies. We are seeing this play out with CDR so it is not as unlikely as you might think. Emissions need to start falling now and they need to fall fast. To sum it up: Lab-grown meat is not a climate solution because it seems very unlikely that it can mitigate farming-based GHG emissions. It would be different if it were our only option, but it’s not. None of this is to say that this is not an interesting niche product that you can be excited about. But we must be careful about what we promote as “Climate Tech” because it impacts the way we allocate both private and public funding. The stakes are simply too high.

In Part 1 we shine a light on Transportation 🚄 In Part 2 we explore the Built Environment. 🏗️ In Part 3 it is time for the Circular Economy ♻️ In Part 4 we look at Industry 🏗️ Today we are looking at Food & Agriculture, from insect farms to plant based meat. Let’s dive in 🌊 First, as always, let’s look at the emissions of Food & Agriculture From the great State of Climate Action 2022 Food and agriculture play vital roles in sustaining the global population, but they come with significant environmental implications. Collectively, these sectors account for about 24% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. Livestock alone contributes to nearly 14.5% of global emissions, with beef and dairy cattle being the primary culprits. Meanwhile, rice cultivation, responsible for around 10% of agricultural methane emissions, and deforestation, often pursued to create new farmlands, further exacerbate the problem. Additionally, about 70% of global freshwater withdrawals are for agriculture.

Climate Drift,We need to talk about Mushrooms,Understanding the __ market & future through Smallhold,"Today in our solution map we are focussing on: mushrooms First: let’s talk about Mushrooms 🍄 According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the average American munches through about 3 pounds of fresh mushrooms every year. Now, put that next to the staggering 214 pounds of meat consumed annually, and you start to see the big picture. When it comes to mushrooms, it's mostly the usual suspects: white button, cremini, and portobello (which are the same type of mushroom harvested at different ages) make up over 95% of mushroom sales stateside. Button, Cremini and portobello mushrooms are all the same mushroom, just at different ages. Button mushrooms (right) are the babies, crimini (brown on the left) are the teenagers, portobello (in the middle) are the adults. Mushrooms are a great alternative protein: they grow easily (and preferably) indoors, are nutrient-packed, thrive on waste materials, and could very well be among the planet's most eco-friendly sources of calories. All they really need is water and a basic growing medium like sawdust. Plus, they're quick growers with cycles as short as six weeks. Why Mushrooms are a great Alternative-Protein Want to understand better why Mushrooms are a great Alternative-Protein? Here 6 perspectives: Nutritional Value : Mushrooms have a relatively high protein content with an average of 19%-35% protein by dry weight, which is comparable to or even higher than some meats like pork and beef. They also contain all 8 essential amino acids required by humans, making them a complete protein source​ ​. When comparing protein content per 100 calories, mushrooms hold their own against many common meat products. For example, while 100 grams of raw mushrooms only has 3.09 grams of protein compared to the higher protein content in meats, on a per 100 calorie basis, mushrooms have 14.04 grams of protein, which is comparable to or better than some meats like pork​ ​. Environmental Impact : Mushrooms have a significantly lower environmental footprint compared to meat. They require a fraction of the land and water needed to produce animal protein and emit substantially less greenhouse gas. The cultivation practices for mushrooms and mycelium are environmentally-friendly, contributing to their sustainability​ ​​ ​​ ​. Health Benefits : Mushrooms offer a range of vitamins and minerals, often in higher amounts per 100 calories compared to meat. They are also low in calories, fat, and cholesterol, making them a healthier choice. Culinary Versatility : Mushrooms provide a unique texture and umami flavor that can replace the savory taste commonly associated with meat, making them a satisfying substitute in various dishes​ ​. Moreover, mushrooms can provide a sense of fullness similar to meat, aiding in hunger control without the added calories and fat​ ​​ ​. Cost-Effectiveness : They are often more cost-effective and easy to incorporate into diets, thus providing a low-cost protein alternative, particularly important in addressing global concerns about food security amid rising populations​ ​. Natural Composition : Mushrooms are all-natural and not ultra-processed like many other alternative proteins. Their minimal processing maintains a rich nutrient profile, making them a more wholesome choice. Despite this, traditional mushroom growers haven't been as quick to innovate in terms of technology, variety, quality, or environmental impact. A look at the mushroom market So far food is only a (small but growing) part of the mushroom market - but this is changing fast. At first glance, the potential in the fresh mushroom market overshadows anything else you might find in the produce aisle. Think back 25 years. Your supermarket's greens section was a pretty simple affair: iceberg lettuce, maybe some spinach and romaine if you were lucky. Fast-forward to today and a trip to a place like Whole Foods is a feast for the eyes. We've got kale, microgreens, Thai basil—you name it. In the same way that kale and other specialty greens shook up the lettuce world, exotic mushrooms are starting to nudge aside the button mushroom's reign. Sure, button mushrooms still rule the roost in terms of sales, but specialty varieties like shiitake and lion's mane are quietly making their move. As consumers get more savvy, they're not just looking for new flavors; they're also hunting for the unique health benefits these exotic mushrooms offer. The end result? Rising sales and a market ripe for innovation. Over the last decade, the market has been sprouting like, well, mushrooms after the rain. We're not just talking about the staples; specialty mushrooms like shiitake, lion's mane, and oyster are making waves. In fact, sales of these exotic fungi shot up by 32% in the 2021-2022 season compared to the previous year. This is not small mushrooms—it's a billion-dollar opportunity, and it's got the wind at its back in the form of several strong market trends: Zooming out When we step back and look at the bigger picture, the U.S. mushroom market, valued at $1.4 billion, is just a fraction of a much larger pie. Globally, mushrooms are a booming $87 billion industry. But wait, there's more. Extend the lens to the broader $600 billion ingredients market, which includes things like veggie burgers, and you start to see the enormous potential for mushrooms to go mainstream. Add to this the adjacent $180 billion-plus market for value-added products, like prepackaged salad kits, and it becomes clear that mushrooms have a role to play in multiple high-value markets. A look outside the US In 2019, world production of commercial mushrooms and recorded truffle collection reported to the Food and Agriculture Organization was 11.9 million tonnes, led by China with 75% of the total. State of the players How button mushrooms are sold typically: in plastic boxes, shrink wrapped A large chunk of America's mushroom supply comes from a small area in southeastern Pennsylvania. Kennett Square, to be exact, is the hub where 70% of the country's mushrooms are grown. Mostly, these are the already shown button mushrooms, which find themselves in styrofoam containers, sealed with plastic wrap, and can take up to 10 days to finally land on your local store's shelves. Today's mushroom market however isn't just a local affair; it's a global competition between 3 parties. On one side, you've got traditional U.S. growers, mainly from Kennett Square, sticking mostly to button and portobello mushrooms. On the other, you've got international players, particularly from Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, who are diving into the world of specialty mushrooms. And last but not least we have the new Vertical Farm Companies, startups trying to innovate. Let’s review them: US Mushroom Farmers These aren't small-time operators; we're talking about massive commercial farms that specialize in the production of button mushrooms. With an industrial-scale setup, they have the capability to grow these fungi in huge quantities and distribute them nationwide. Their reach is extensive, spanning from local grocery stores to big chains, making them a formidable player in the mushroom market. Given their scale and established distribution networks, they have the muscle to get their products on store shelves across the country, often in a shorter time frame than smaller or newer entrants to the market. Example Brands: Phillips Mushroom Farms, L.P. Monterey Mushrooms Imports When it comes to mushroom imports, a significant player is China. These mushrooms make their way to the U.S. through container ships, covering thousands of miles before landing on store shelves. While these imports add variety to the market, they often fall short on quality. Coming in cans ro wrapped in plastic, they don't exactly scream ""fresh,"" which is increasingly what today's consumers are looking for. Moreover, the long journey they take inherently means they aren't locally sourced, another factor that matters to a growing number of shoppers. Vertical Farm Companies Vertical farms have been popping up globally with the promise of revolutionizing agriculture, especially when it comes to leafy greens. The idea is enticing: stack crops vertically in controlled environments to maximize yield and minimize land use. However, many of these operations face significant hurdles when it comes to scaling their production and actually getting their products out the door. Even as they hit bumps in the road, they often announce new varieties they claim to grow, only to encounter the same scalability issues all over again. Example Brands: Bowery Plenty Spotlight: Bowery Farming Bowery Farming, based in New York, is  recognized as the largest vertical farming operation in the US, where it grows pesticide-free lettuce, leafy greens, and herbs, serving major retailers across over 850 locations​​. The company raised a total of $472 million from Google Ventures, General Catalyst, GGV Capital and Temasek. Bowery Farming operates with the mission of transforming the fresh food supply chain to become smarter, safer, and more sustainable. Their indoor vertical farms, situated outside cities, are designed to produce food without pesticides and pollutants, utilizing lesser water and land compared to traditional farming methods. This farming model is powered by their proprietary farm operating system, BoweryOS, which integrates AI, software, and hardware to streamline the food system while focusing on freshness, flavor, and safety. Bowery's farms can generate 100 times more produce per square foot of land than traditional agriculture, using 100% renewable energy and 90% less water​​. So far they haven’t launched a mushroom product, but they might be working on it. Introducing Smallhold Andrew Carter, co-founder and CEO of mushroom startup Smallhold, stands inside one of the company’s grow chambers. Smallhold initially entered the market as a supplier of fresh mushrooms to restaurants and grocery stores in New York City. Recognizing an opportunity for on-site cultivation, the company launched Minifarms, compact mushroom-growing systems that could be placed in partner hotels and restaurants. The COVID-19 pandemic served as a catalyst for change in Smallhold's business strategy. With more people cooking at home, the demand for unique and quality ingredients like mushrooms increased. The company adapted by adding a direct-to-consumer model, offering mushroom grow kits for home delivery. During this period of uncertainty, Smallhold's mushrooms gained traction as a source of culinary exploration for many households. Customers reveled in watching the unique shapes and colors of their mushrooms grow, and then experimenting with new recipes. After the pandemic Smallhold’s go to market focussed again on retail: Currently, Smallhold's freshly harvested mushrooms are available in over 500 retail stores, including established chains like Whole Foods, Central Market, and Albertsons. Notably, Smallhold has become the fastest-growing fresh mushroom brand in Whole Foods, shifting the chain's previous reliance on California-based small scale suppliers. Why grow indoor Mushrooms are an ideal candidate for indoor cultivation for several reasons, giving companies like Smallhold a competitive edge over outdoor growers, especially those focused on leafy greens. Firstly, mushrooms have a low dependency on light, which is a significant advantage when it comes to indoor farming where natural light is limited. Secondly, mushrooms are traditionally grown in a vertical arrangement, making efficient use of space—a crucial factor for indoor setups where real estate can be expensive. Lastly, mushrooms thrive under tightly controlled environmental conditions, such as specific humidity and temperature levels. These conditions are challenging to maintain outdoors, where weather can be unpredictable, but are easier to regulate in an indoor setting. Overall, these factors make mushroom cultivation more suited for indoor environments and allow Smallhold to compete more effectively than those growing crops that are more dependent on outdoor conditions. Smallhold has 3 approaches: Macrofarms (large centralized farms that then deliver the finished mushrooms to shops), microfarms (boxes inside shops that grow mushrooms), D2C (grow kits). Macro Farms Smallhold's Macrofarms serve as specialized mushroom-growing facilities designed with mushrooms in mind. These spaces are constructed using modular refrigeration panels that come in flat-pack form, making them easy to assemble. This efficient design enables a streamlined and optimized environment for mushroom fruiting, allowing for greater control over variables like temperature and humidity. Micro Farms In 2022, Smallhold took its concept of farm-to-table even further by installing ""mirco farms"" directly in markets. These eye-catching units are constructed from glass and metal and emanate a blue glow, giving them a futuristic appearance. More than just aesthetically pleasing, these minifarms serve a functional purpose. They allow mushrooms to be grown and harvested on-site, ensuring peak freshness and minimal transit time from farm to consumer. D2C Smallhold's grow kits offer a simplified, hands-on experience for those interested in mushroom cultivation at home. Each kit contains a bag filled with a specially-prepared substrate, which is the material that mushrooms grow on. Once set up, the substrate bag will fruit, meaning it will produce mushroom bodies. Depending on the size of the kit, customers can expect a yield ranging from .75 to 3 pounds of fresh mushrooms. This DIY approach not only provides an educational experience for the consumer but also caters to the increasing demand for local and sustainably produced food. The bull case on Smallhold So why am I bullish on Smallhold? 6 reasons why Smallhold will succeed. Variety of Products: Smallhold offers more than 10 types of mushrooms, each having its own unique flavor, texture, and nutritional benefits. This variety aims to cater to a wide range of consumer preferences, especially those interested in exploring options beyond the common mushroom types. Distributed Farming: Unlike centralized mushroom farms, Smallhold's farming facilities are spread out across the U.S. This distributed approach aims to reduce transportation distances and, as a result, lower the company's overall carbon footprint. Certification and Technology: The farms operate under organic certification and utilize advanced technology to create optimal conditions for each type of mushroom. The goal is to produce a high-quality, environmentally responsible product. Resource Efficiency: Smallhold's farming operations are designed to be efficient in terms of water and energy usage, aiming to go beyond industry standards. The company also opts for compostable packaging to further its commitment to sustainability. Waste Utilization: Smallhold grows all its mushrooms on sawdust, effectively repurposing a material that often goes to waste. This approach aligns with the company's sustainability goals and also diverts waste from landfills. Market Gap: The U.S. mushroom market currently lacks a dominant, recognizable brand. This presents an opportunity for companies like Smallhold to establish themselves in a growing market. The bear case And now time for the bear case: 6 reasons why will Smallhold will not succeed. Limited Market Reach Smallhold focuses on exotic mushrooms, which have not yet gained widespread popularity. The mainstream market still leans towards traditional varieties like button and portobello mushrooms. It will need a lot of education to show the consumers everything they can do with these new mushrooms. Competitive Landscape The company faces strong competition from established mushroom growers. What is stopping them from going into exotic mushrooms too? Other vertical farming startups with larger financial backing could easily diversify into the mushroom sector. Operational Challenges Smallhold's distributed farming model could lead to issues in quality control and consistency. Managing multiple growing locations may result in increased operational costs. Retail Space Requirements Smallhold's ""Micro Farms"" need to be placed in retail spaces, requiring retailers to give up valuable square footage - and they would be more willing to do that to the established partners. DIY Mushroom Kits One Go to market of Smallhold are DIY mushroom kits. The concept may not appeal to the mass market, limiting this revenue stream. The kits also face competition from ready-to-eat mushroom products. Regulatory Hurdles Maintaining organic certifications and other regulatory standards can be complex and may impact production and costs. Overall, while Smallhold has a novel concept approach and good track record so far. It faces significant challenges in market acceptance, competition, operational efficiency, and regulatory compliance that could limit its growth and profitability. Mushrooms are poised to play a significant role in the future of sustainable food production, and companies like Smallhold are leading the charge. With their innovative approaches to mushroom farming, ranging from large-scale macro farms to microfarms situated right in the grocery stores, they're setting a precedent for what the future of food cultivation could look like. Let's keep our eyes on this fascinating shift in the food landscape. Who knows? The next time you're at a grocery store, it might not just be apples and oranges catching your eye, but a vibrant array of sustainably grown, locally sourced mushrooms.

Climate Drift,We need to talk about rocks,Explaining Carbon Removal through Carbon Mineralisation,"Rocking CO2 Rocks are by far the largest carbon reservoir on earth, containing more than 99% of the Earth’s carbon.  Carbon is held in rocks for thousands to millions of years. Rocks have modulated the climate (by releasing and absorbing carbon dioxide at planetary scale) over most of the Earth’s history.  Since the industrial revolution, we’ve been taking carbon from the geosphere and pumping it into the atmosphere.  Rocks can capture and return carbon - a lot of carbon - from the atmosphere to the geosphere and can be a big part of the solution to the climate emergency. The CDR pathway that uses rocks is called carbon mineralization. The best rocks for carbon mineralization There is a special type of rock called ultramafic.  Ultramafic rock forms deep underground when really hot melted rock cools down slowly and the right minerals come together.  About 5% of the Earth’s crust is ultramafic, and most of it is buried deep underground. Ultramafic rock contains a lot of magnesium, which reacts naturally to CO 2 in the atmosphere and forms stable inert crystals.  So ultramafic rock is potentially a very significant tool in the fight against climate change. Credit: iStock / Getty Images There are several ways to take advantage of the CDR potential of ultramafic rock One way is to pump CO 2 below ground into ultramafic rock deposits.  There are CDR companies that are developing systems to send concentrated CO2 into ultramafic deposits, for example and . Other companies, such as and focus on injecting into ‘mafic’ rock which has less magnesium but is more prevalent and can be more porous. These companies use rock for ‘storage’ of CO 2 , but only after the CO 2 has been captured somehow by a Direct Air Capture (DAC) system. As they are developed, these emerging capture+storage systems will need to reduce the relatively high energy, water and infrastructure costs of DAC plants. A second way is to allow ultramafic rock to come into contact with the air so it can react with atmospheric CO2 naturally.  Some CDR companies spread rocks over soils or use the ocean, using a tech pathway called Enhanced Weathering for example , , , and .  These emerging systems will be focussed on reducing costs and energy requirements to crush and transport rock to site, measuring impact, and managing potential environmental risks. But there is another way – to leverage gigatonnes of ultramafic rock that are already lying on the Earth’s surface and can be exposed to the atmosphere. Credit: Arca Surficial rocking of CO 2 The mining industry brings millions of tonnes of ultramafic rock to the surface every year.  Ultramafic rock hosts nickel and other important minerals essential in the energy transition. In some mine operations, companies separate the nickel from its ultramafic host, and the leftover rock, in the form of a fine crushed sand, called tailings, is deposited in a Tailings Storage Facilities (TSF). Some TSFs are places where large amounts of crushed ultramafic rock are exposed to the air, reacting naturally, and very slowly, with CO 2 .  But there are ways to speed this up. works with crushed ultramafic rock in the TSF to dramatically increase the reaction speed and storage capacity using proprietary techniques. Other companies like have their own methods and technologies. Mining is one of the few industries that processes billions of tonnes of material every year.  Even if only some of that material can capture atmospheric carbon dioxide, then surficial mineralization can make a significant contribution in the struggle to respond to the climate emergency. Credit: Shutterstock Fun facts, advantages and challenges with surficial mineralization The right type of nickel mine can capture a large amount of CO 2 - 20% by weight in its tailings storage facility.  A large nickel mine can produce 10,000,000 tonnes of tailings per year, therefore has the potential to capture and store 2,000,000 tonnes of atmospheric carbon dioxide (more than what 400,000 cars would emit in a year).  But nickel isn’t the only critical mineral hosted in ultramafic rock.  Around the world, there are currently 150 ultramafic-hosted operating mines across all commodity types (chromium, platinum-group elements, diamonds, iron, vanadium and titanium), so that’s a lot of potential CDR.  But there are also legacy mines (closed) with billions of tonnes of tailings, and hundreds of new mines to be developed in order to meet the demand for battery metals in the clean energy transition.  And each mine has a stockpile of unprocessed waste ultramafic rock that could also be exploited for CDR. In other words, mining could generate a lot of CDR. Advantages Surficial mineralization as a CDR pathway has some distinct advantages. Capture and storage are combined in a single step. It is energy efficient – the rock is already crushed and moved for metals extraction. CDR using ultramafic mine waste is highly durable, with storage at geological time scales It doesn’t require new land The mining industry is very good at moving the large volumes of material that are needed for CDR at sufficient scale Challenges Like all emerging pathways, surficial mineralization has challenges.  The technology for surficial mineralization is nascent.  There is technology risk and a lot to learn to get to scale. Moreover, while the numbers seem vast, surficial mineralization has a finite feedstock.  There is only so much suitable rock, unlike a pathway like DAC which has unlimited feedstock.  Yet there is consensus on the necessary expansion of the supply of nickel and other critical metals that are hosted in ultramafic rock.  And Arca’s technology will be able to work with other alkaline waste streams. The mining industry contains many examples of leading companies making Net Zero commitments, and there is great interest in exploring this pathway.  Arca has already partnered with several of the world’s top mining companies. Like many novel CDR pathways, the regulations haven't yet anticipated surficial mineralization.  Governments around the world are examining different approaches to removing CO2 from the atmosphere and beginning to introduce policies and incentives to accelerate deployment. Credit: Shutterstock This is a journey Surficial mineralization is an emerging and exciting new CDR pathway.  By 2050 it will be part of humanity’s portfolio of solutions to the climate emergency. And it is based on the humble rock. So the next time you go outside, pick up a rock and give it a hug. It may just be helping to save the world! We hope you have found a newfound appreciation of rocks.

Let’s dive in 🌊 Imagine you're in a bustling food market halfway across the world. The air is thick with spices, and a vendor hands you a skewer. It looks like meat, smells like meat, even tastes like meat. But it's not. Welcome to the new frontier: alternative proteins. From plant-based burgers that ooze 'juice', to lab-grown chicken that has never seen the light of day, the rules are changing. We're not just talking plants, but fermentation, cultivated meat, mushrooms and insects;. Why? Because our current ways are not sustainable, and we need options. So pull up a chair, dig in, and let's explore the world of alt-proteins. TLDR: The 30 second version of this Deep Dive Food systems are responsible for about 25% of global greenhouse gas emissions; from land use change, on-farm production, processing, transport, packaging, and retail. About 30% of food emissions arise directly from livestock and fisheries, with ruminant livestock like cattle being major methane emitters. Additionally, crop production, including both human and animal consumption, accounts for roughly a quarter of food emissions. Various solutions are being explored to reduce emission in food and agriculture. On the farm side we have sensors measuring crop production & emissions, automation, and climate-tolerant crops. Animal farming explores carbon capture techniques, like cattle feed additives. Embracing sustainable methods, we see the rise of regenerative and hydroponic farming. Efforts in food waste revolve around analytics and surplus management, Food Coatings are making sure that food doesn’t spoil in the first place. Last but not least the focus of this series: Alternative proteins, from plant-based meat to fermentation and cultivated meat. The problem: The impact of food The food sector, encompassing the entire cycle from farm to fork, is a substantial source of greenhouse gas emissions, with meat production being a significant contributor. But meat is not the only emitting source: the production, transportation, processing, and waste management - all contribute to its carbon footprint. Starting with production , ruminant animals like cows and sheep emit methane, a potent greenhouse gas, during digestion. Additionally, the cultivation of feed for these animals necessitates the use of fertilizers, releasing nitrous oxide, another impactful greenhouse gas. Meat production alone accounts for around 14.5% of global emissions, with methane forming a major portion of this - this is why there is such a big focus on alternative proteins as a solution. Land-use change for agriculture, especially for pastures or feed cultivation, often plainly means deforestation, diminishing the earth's carbon dioxide absorption capacity. This land use change is severe; . Formerly forested and wild areas have been converted for agricultural use, leading to a significant loss of natural habitat and a decline in biodiversity. Transportation and processing of mea t further add to its carbon footprint due to the burning of fossil fuels. Additionally, waste generated throughout the meat supply chain, like organic waste in landfills, produces methane. The emissions from Agriculture, forestry and other land uses according to the IPCC. The hope is that Alternative Proteins have a lower emissions footprint, requiring less land, water, and energy compared to meat. 💧 A note on water Agriculture's environmental impact extends beyond meat production. It's a hefty consumer of freshwater, causing environmental pressures in water-stressed regions, and a significant polluter of water bodies through nutrient discharge. Agriculture drives around one-quarter of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, making it a crucial player in climate change. Let’s dive deeper into the numbers Out of the 52.3 billion tonnes of CO₂-equivalents released globally, 26% are attributed to food production, while 74% come from non-food sources. In order of emissions: Livestock & Fisheries: This sector contributes the highest at 31%. A significant chunk of this is from methane produced by cattle. Crop Production: This follows closely at 27%. - Crops for Human Consumption: The bulk of the crop related emissions at 21%. - Crops for Animal Feed: These emissions account for 6% of food-related emissions. Land Use: It accounts for 24%, with land use changes, such as deforestation, being the major contributor at 18%. - Land Use for Livestock: It's double that of human food land use at 16%. - Land Use for Human Food: This contributes 8% to the food emissions. Supply Chain: This encompasses various stages including retail (3%), packaging (5%), transport (6%), and food processing (4%), totaling 18%. Don’t have enough numbers yet? Let’s zoom in more: The impact of some of our favorite food One thing we are building at Climate Drift is a large-scale visualization to show the scale of emissions and the sources. Thankfully, we have already finished the part for food, here are a first sneak-peak: Tap/Click to zoom in and explore our food emissions map Comparing Meats When looking at the carbon footprint of meats, beef emerges as the most significant contributor to CO2 emissions. At 99.48kg of CO2 per kilogram, beef's impact is notably higher than other meats. For comparison, lamb generates 39.72kg CO2 for every kilogram, which is significantly less than beef, but still higher than most other meat types. Poultry and pig are comparatively more carbon-efficient, with emissions of 9.87kg and 12.31kg CO2 per kilogram, respectively. This makes chicken nearly ten times less impactful in terms of carbon emissions compared to beef. Dairy vs. Plant-Based The dairy industry, particularly cheese, also has a substantial carbon footprint. Parmesan cheese, for instance, contributes 19.1kg of CO2 for every kilogram produced. On the flip side, plant-based foods such as tofu exhibit much lower emissions, with only 3.16kg of CO2 per kilogram. When juxtaposed, choosing tofu over Parmesan could significantly reduce one's carbon footprint. Breakfast Choices Even our morning meals can have varying carbon impacts. A liter of orange juice, for instance, has a footprint of 6kg CO2, while an 800g loaf of bread only has 0.63kg CO2. This suggests that opting for a slice of bread over a glass of orange juice in the morning might be a more environmentally conscious choice. Choose your taco, choose your emissions Taco choices also showcase varying carbon footprints. Four vegan bean and avocado tacos result in 4kg CO2, whereas the veggie variant with avocado doubles the footprint at 10kg CO2. Interestingly, opting for beef and cheese tacos significantly increases the emissions to 33kg CO2. Thus, transitioning from beef to plant-based tacos can make a notable difference in one's dietary carbon footprint. So where does this leave us? Ignoring the emissions from food systems isn't an option if global climate targets are to be met. In a business-as-usual scenario, it's projected that food systems could emit around 1356 billion tonnes of CO2-equivalent by 2100, overshooting the carbon budget for limiting global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C. At the same time: without food there is no humanity. So, what are the solutions to this challenge? The solutions Tap/click to explore our Food & Agriculture solutions As we have established, we need a lot of solutions to curb Agriculture and Food emissions and quickly.  Thankfully, we are currently tracking quite a few of those: Farm Soils: The solutions encompass soil carbon measurement, farm monitoring, and soil improvements. The focus broadens to different farm types, such as Macro and Micro farms. Crop Production: This solution space involves the use of automated farm equipment, pest control measures, and sensors for crops. A big focus is also on the development of new climate-tolerant crops, particularly rice and wheat. Software Solutions : Software is eating everything, including food & ag. The current focus is on emissions analysis, aiming to provide a clearer insight into the environmental impact of various agricultural practices. Food Waste : In food waste there are 2 frons: residential and commercial. Solutions address  analytics, efficient surplus management, and overordering. 🌊 A personal highlight here is Food Coatings. Animal & Livestock Farms: The category spotlights farm carbon capture techniques, diving into methods such as cattle feed additives, manure digestion, and biogas capture. Sustainable Agriculture: Sustainable methods form the backbone of this category, encompassing techniques from regenerative aquaculture and farming to more sci-fi approaches. These modern methods include vertical, indoor, and hydroponic farming, each promising a reduced environmental footprint. For this deep dive we are focussing on the right side: Alternative Proteins. The Hype Curve of Food & Agriculture Different solutions are differently far on the hype curve of solution, let’s take a quick reality check across phases: Innovation trigger The curve starts with innovations in their infancy, capturing the initial excitement and promise. Solutions such as Fermentation and different Food Waste Solutions are at this early stage, suggesting a recent emergence and potential for future development. Peak expectations Moving up the curve, technologies like Regenerative Farming and Cultivated meats find themselves here. This stage comes with high anticipation and buzz around these technologies, but they might not have seen widespread application yet. Trough of disillusionment This stage signifies that after the initial excitement, certain technologies have encountered challenges. Innovations like Vertical Farming and Alternative Proteins are currently navigating the pitfalls and obstacles that come after the initial hype fades. Slope of enlightenment Technologies at this phase, such as Crop production Sensors and Automation , indicate a growing understanding and wider implementation. They are on the path of steady growth, overcoming challenges, and refining their applications. Plateau of productivity At this mature stage, technologies like Plant based Milk have found stable and widespread use. They've passed the earlier stages and have become generally accepted and integrated into regular consumption. Want to understand Hype Curves better and what leads a technology to transition from one stage to the next? Check out our guide here: What’s next Now we're aware of the significant role the global food system plays & the numerous solutions available. In the next parts it's time to explore Alternative Proteins. The goal is always to replace conventional meat with more sustainable alternatives, given the inefficiency of the Plant -> Animal -> Food chain. We will dive into: Plant-Based Meat: Is it possible to craft meat entirely from plants? And will consumers embrace it? Fermentation: Can fermentation offer us the alternatives we're searching for? Cultivated Meat: Is it possible to cultivate meat without an actual animal? What are the challenges that we faced for this so far? What other solutions are out there? We will look at Mushrooms & Insects.

Climate Drift,Climate Tech Has a Marketing Problem. Good Storytelling Can Fix It.,How to unleash the power of storytelling for your climate company. Learn how to quickly and clearly communicate what you do and how it can helpÉ,"Subscribe Storytelling gets a lot of hype these days. After decades of line graphs and bar charts, the climate tech industry is beginning to realize that data alone won’t outperform the millions of dollars being spent by the fossil fuel industry on advertising and PR. Lots of people are talking about the importance of storytelling around green initiatives and climate change. Here’s the problem: The majority of discussions never move beyond, “storytelling is important!” Very few people are actually teaching climate companies how to do it well. So founders, oftentimes brilliant scientists and engineers, fumble through presentations focused on product features , missing the opportunity to tell their audience about product benefits . Startup websites use lots of space to explain how their company is innovative and neglect to talk about why it’s important . They mistakenly believe that storytelling means telling their brand story, when in reality they need to be talking about themselves less. In Part 1 of this series, we explored the ways in which many climate tech startups struggle to explain what they do. Today we’re going to introduce a tool climate leaders can use to organize their work into a story that communicates their value. A Framework for Telling Your Story Luke and Obi-Wan. Harry and Dumbledore. Katniss and Haymitch. Daniel and Mr. Miyagi. It turns out that many of our favorite books and movies can model how to tell your company’s story well. They all follow a common narrative arc called the Hero’s Journey: a basic structure humans have used for centuries to craft stories that entertain, inform, and inspire. The outline provides a way to organize information that clearly conveys the characters, the stakes, the challenges, and the vision of success at the end of a journey. An organization called Storybrand has adapted the Hero’s Journey into a framework businesses can use to tell their story. Here’s the plot of Star Wars as an example: A Character (or Hero): Luke Skywalker Has a Problem: Needs to defeat the evil Galactic Empire And Meets a Guide: Obi-Wan Kenobi Who Gives Them a Plan: Become a Jedi; Trust the Force And Calls Them to Action: Join the Rebellion, defeat the Empire That Ends in Success: The Rebellion wins And Avoids Failure: The Rebellion gets crushed Climate tech companies often struggle to tell their story well because they have lots of information and no way to organize it. They aren’t sure what to include, what to leave out, and what order to say things in. Climate tech companies often struggle to tell their story well because they have lots of information and no way to organize it. By spreading the information out through a narrative structure people are accustomed to, they will be able to clearly articulate their value in ways that make their audience lean in and listen. Implementing Storytelling Techniques into Your Climate Tech Startup Now that you have the basic storytelling framework, you can get started plotting your company’s story. Here are a few important things to keep in mind as you map it out: If there’s one thing you take away from this article, it should be this: when you tell your company’s story, your company is not the Hero . Your customer is the Hero and your company is the Guide. You exist to help them solve their problem. Climate tech founders are, understandably, proud of their companies and the solutions they are creating. But this can cause them to spend too much time talking about themselves. Your customers view themselves as the Hero characters in their own stories. If you tell a story where you’re positioned as the Hero, it won’t fit into their narrative and you’ll be ignored. Hone your language around the Problem as much as possible. The better you articulate a customer’s problem, the more attention they’ll give you. Show that you understand and empathize with the surface-level issues they’re facing AND the emotional implications (frustration, inconvenience, etc.) of that problem. Give a clear call to action. If the first button on your website is, “Learn More,” kill it with fire. Learn More is vague and doesn’t move visitors closer to implementing your solution in their lives. People will go where you invite them to go. Make your calls to action specific: Schedule a Demo, Get a Free Quote, Order Now, Join the Waitlist, etc. Cast a compelling vision of success. After you articulate the customer’s problem, paint them a picture of what life looks like after you’ve solved their problem. If your company works in the home electrification business, don’t simply talk about switching out furnaces for heat pumps. Talk about giving people comfortable, efficient homes that they will feel proud to live in. Finally, it’s worth mentioning that this exercise might be difficult for a founder or an executive team. You’re not only honing how you tell your story to outsiders; you may be clarifying your top-level leadership’s own understanding of the work you do. But gaining clarity internally is one of the most important things you can do to help your climate company grow. Distilling Your Brand Story into a One-Liner Once you feel good about how you’ve mapped out your company’s story (and you’ve tested it out on a few people who aren’t familiar with what you do) you can condense it further into a one-liner. One-liners are a quick sentence or two that explain what you do and who you do it for. The basic structure is: Problem ➡️ Solution ➡️ Result Most [hero] are dealing with [problem]. At [company], we [function] so that [successful outcome]. It’s pretty rare for companies to have one-liners, so here are a few I came up with for organizations whose work I appreciate: “Lots of homeowners hesitate to start home electrification projects because the process is confusing and managing multiple contractors is a huge headache. At Zero Homes, we simplify the process from start to finish so that homeowners can enjoy a comfortable, energy-efficient home without the stress.” “Most solar installers are dealing with a patchwork of assorted design and sales software, which is clunky, inefficient, and frustrating. At Aurora Solar, we provide cloud-based software that helps solar installers streamline their sales process and close more deals.” “More and more corporate sustainability teams are feeling the pressure to create effective carbon reduction strategies. At Watershed, we provide software to help them gather reliable emissions data so they can measure, report, and reduce carbon output across their operations.” Use the structure above as a guideline, and feel free to adapt it a little bit so that your one-liner sounds natural and interesting. You won’t be able to capture all of the nuance of what you do in the one-liner, but that isn’t the point. The point is to concisely convey the value you create in order to open the door to a conversation where you can dive deeper. Why This All Matters Once you achieve clarity on your customer’s story and your company’s role in that story, that clarity will spread into all of your communications channels. Founders will have an easier time talking to investors about the work you do. Your sales team will have consistent language they can use when talking to customers that will close more deals. Your website’s home page (your company’s only 24/7 salesperson) will be able to clearly articulate your customer’s pain points and how your company steps in to provide solutions that lead them to success. Now that you have a one-liner, you can modify it to be the first thing a visitor sees when they visit your site, along with a clear call to action inviting them to take the next step. Agricultural software company Propagate does a good job with this in the hero section of their website: (although I’d get rid of the Learn More button) Beyond external communications, clarifying your story can do wonders for staff and board cohesion. Imagine getting all of your internal stakeholders on the same page with a one-liner and asking them to memorize it. Now they have a clear North Star for why they show up to work every day. As an added benefit, you also now have dozens or hundreds of people with a good answer to the question they’ll get at happy hours and backyard barbecues: “So, what do you do?” It’s free marketing for your company, and the staff won’t have to improvise answers on the spot. The biggest threat to your company’s growth isn’t the economy or staff turnover or access to funding. It’s noise. It’s getting lost in the sea of information and messaging because you don’t clearly articulate what you do. The biggest threat to your company’s growth is noise By telling a story where the customer is the Hero, you are the Guide, and your solution is the Plan, you’ll align your staff around a clear mission and stand above your competitors in the battle for attention in the marketplace. If climate and sustainability initiatives are going to scale at the rate we need them to, we need to learn how to tell our stories. They are better stories than the tired, old, usually flat-out untrue stories the fossil fuel companies are telling. They’re stories that point toward the future, when our societies are built on technology that harnesses the clean, renewable energy all around us. When people adopt sustainable lifestyles that work in tune with the earth rather than exploiting it. By telling clear and compelling stories, we have the opportunity to invite people to join that future today.

Climate Tech Distillery,#29 Water Distribution,A big source of water and energy waste,"Read time: 4 minutes In this week’s issue you will learn about the issues facing our water networks and how important it is to fix them: Water Distribution Smart Water Magazine Subscribe to learn about climate tech topics explained in simple terms every week 🎉 Subscribe “8.6 trillion gallons of water are lost each year through leaks“ - The World Bank Top Water Distribution News 🗞️ All the info you need about the current smart water networks ecosystem (key countries, manufacturers, market size, etc.). 1.6 million people in Jordan will benefit from this new project to tackle Jordan’s water crisis and build climate resilience. A list of the winners of the 2023 Global Water Awards. Let’s dive in 🧠 Luckily for most of us today getting water is as simple as opening the tap. But the truth is that there is a huge complex process of water distribution behind this. Source: Dream Civil Water networks have 2 main issues we need to fix: Energy Leaks Energy Pumping water from source to treatment plants to storage and distribution requires huge amounts of energy. So much that the treatment and transport of water consumes close to 4% of the world’s energy and its carbon emissions are close to those of the aviation industry. Unless water comes from reserves at higher altitudes, in most places the water system relies on pumps. All that pumping of water is what demands so much energy, and what drives up the price of water. In fact, electricity is the major cost driver of processing and distributing water. Leaks In the United States, an estimated 1/6 of distributed water escapes the system. That number is even higher in low income countries, where it can reach over 80%! Leakage rate in water distribution networks Source: ResearchGate This is due to poor quality or aging infrastructure as well as water pressure management issues. If you have bad quality pipes, pumps, screws, etc. of course water is going to escape. Getting a replacement is neither financially tenable nor necessary except in extreme cases or when public health is at risk. Pressure is also key. If there is too little, water doesn’t get to where it needs go, and if there’s too much, pipes can explode. All of this water waste takes us to a key concept: “non-revenue water” (NRW) Non-revenue water This refers to the gallons of water lost during distribution. It is the difference between what comes into the system and what eventually comes out of the tap. Simply from its name you can guess how important water waste is for utility companies and municipalities. Source: Open International 10% NRW levels are considered well within the bounds of good water management but the problem is that the global average is around 20%! Leaks are the #1 cause of NRW but there’s also meter and paperwork problems. Fixing non-revenue water will help us save trillions of gallons of water but it will also help us save huge amounts of energy from pumping all that water that ends up leaking. Solutions Infrastructure: We have to invest in fixing the infrastructure we already have. Energy recycling: We are already using so much energy to move water around, so instead of wasting it let’s recover as much of it as we can! What we are doing with hydropower but at a “pipe-scale”. A startup mentioned below is doing just that! Data: We have to create “smart/intelligent water networks”. By having more sensors all around water networks we’ll be able to optimize pressure levels and locate leaks in near-real-time. This way we’ll optimize electricity use and water flow. Source: Stantec Fixing our water systems will help us: Save trillions of gallons of water and hundreds of billions of dollars. Become more resilient to increasingly frequent water shortages. Reduce CO2 emissions. So why haven’t we fixed them all already? Challenges Reputation: In many cases municipal governments or utility companies prefer not to acknowledge leakage problems because that also means acknowledging management problems. Capacity and incentives: It is common that utilities fail to tackle the issue of water loss because they lack enough technical or institutional capacity and incentives/requirements to act. Water is very cheap: Most water systems can’t afford to invest in upgrading distribution systems due to a lack of revenue. In some cases, operating costs exceed water revenues, particularly in times of drought that lead to greater conservation and reduced revenue. Top Water Distribution Companies 💰 They create intelligent water networks. Their solutions instrument, analyse and control water networks to reduce leakage, reduce energy consumption and improve supply. Their leakage management system provides automatic leakage calculation and real-time alarming for early warning. With their in-pipe turbines they are able to harness the flow of water through existing pipes to efficiently generate power and turn it into usable electricity.

Climate Tech Distillery,#28 Regenerative Agriculture,The key to fixing climate change through agriculture,"Read time: 5 minutes In this week’s issue you will learn about the right techniques to use when farming and the huge impact they have on climate change: Regenerative Agriculture Source: Kiss The Ground Subscribe to learn about climate tech topics explained in simple terms every week 🎉 Subscribe “The Earth’s soil contains more than 3 times the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. To reach net zero, we need soil to absorb even more of it.“ - Al Gore Top Regenerative Agriculture News 🗞️ In Fast Company’s 2023 Most Innovative Companies in the World list, Regrow has been named #1 in Agriculture and #41 overall. The company is planning to invest $216 million in regenerative agriculture projects across the US to get closer to its net zero goals. Kering and L’Occitane Group launch a €300 million fund to invest in nature conservation and restoration initiatives and to help farmers transition to regenerative agriculture. Let’s dive in 🧠 Close to 19% of global CO2 emissions come from agriculture and 38% of the world’s land is classified as “agricultural area” by the FAO. Source: Our World in Data (History Database of the Global Environment, 2017) Besides cow farts and energy use, the biggest issue when it comes to agriculture and emissions is the way in which we are treating our land to produce the food we, and the animals we eat, eat. The best example of this is the “Dust Bowl”, a 1930s phenomenon that blew much of the Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas region topsoil away with the wind. This happened because the really bad farming techniques depleted the plains. Source How stuff works So what’s wrong with traditional industrial farming? Plows tear apart the soil’s connective tissue, disrupting the natural ecosystem and pouring CO2 into the air. We then use fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides to try to get more productivity out of the depleted land. This pollutes the land and the water streams even more and causes the release of nitrous oxide into the air (a gas 300 times worse for climate change than CO2). And why is soil so important? Global carbon stocks/sinks (in billions of tons) Source: US Department of Agriculture Soil is created over time, as carbon-rich plants and animal residues are broken down by bacteria. The organic matter that’s left is a perfect storage for carbon and also nutrients for plants. Healthy soil contains many pores, plant roots, worms and fungi. These micro-tunnels allow roots to grow into the soil and help the soil retain more water and become more resistant to droughts. Remember, the darker and the richer the soil, the better! Sure, but what is regenerative agriculture? It’s a set of centuries-old farming and grazing practices that enhance the soil’s ability to retain carbon. These are the 6 main methods: Minimising chemical inputs: They destroy biodiversity and pollute waterways. Minimising tilling systems: Tilling exposes buried organic matter to oxygen, which releases CO2 into the air. Source: ResearchGate Incorporating livestock: This combines animals and plants in a circular ecosystem. Increasing biodiversity: To boost nutrients, natural decomposition and attract insect predators of pests. Rotating crops: To naturally balance what is being taken out and put into the soil. Cover crops: To maintain the soil as carbon rich and humid as possible. And the main advantages: Produce and quality: Because of the very rich soil, the land becomes way more resilient and can last for many more years yielding high quality produce. Yield: This really depends o the specific crop and the local conditions. In the long-term yield tends to stay the same or even increase whereas in industrial farming it decreases quickly or becomes more costly to maintain. Climate change: Instead of being a huge carbon releaser, land used for agriculture can become a massive carbon sink when using the right techniques. Source: Kiss the Ground Other revenue streams: By using regenerative agriculture techniques, farmers can potentially start selling carbon credits which others can use to offset their emissions. Regenerative agriculture has the potential to help us restore biodiversity and avoid emitting billions of tonnes of CO2. Individual farmers and large companies worldwide are already starting to invest in it but why isn’t it everywhere? Challenges Yield: These techniques can potentially lead to lower yields. It depends a lot on the type of crop and the local conditions. Farmers’ knowledge: Many farmers will need to acquire new knowledge and skills to change their industrial farming mindset. Cost: Near-term costs can exceed the farmer’s budgets even if in the long-term the profits exceed the costs. Governments must provide incentives to farmers to switch to regenerative agriculture. Top Regenerative Agriculture Startups 💰 Luckily there are many more but this is just a small varied sample. This Web3 project has created a marketplace for tokenized regenerative agriculture carbon credits with full transparency thanks to blockchain. Buyers can see all the details about the carbon removed from the credits they buy.

Climate Tech Distillery,#27 Retrofitting,The forgotten part of making buildings green,"Read time: 4 minutes In this week’s issue you will learn about how crucial it is to make existing buildings more sustainable: Retrofitting Source: Fine Homebuilding Subscribe to learn about climate tech topics explained in simple terms every week 🎉 Subscribe “Investing $279 billion in retrofitting buildings in the US would yield more than $1 trillion in energy savings over 10 years” - Rockefeller Foundation and Deutsche Bank Top Retrofitting News 🗞️ At the International Energy Agency (IEA) conference in Paris, retrofitting buildings was one of the two key topics. The White House just released more than $830 million in funding and $4 billion in loan commitment for the Inflation Reduction Act’s Green and Resilient Retrofit Program. None of the world’s richest countries are retrofitting buildings fast enough . We need to go from a retrofitting rate of 1% per year to 2.5% per year. Source: 3Keel Let’s dive in 🧠 Worldwide, buildings account for 32% of energy use and 19% of energy-related greenhouse emissions. And much as 80% of the energy they consume is wasted (lights left on unnecessarily, poor insulation, etc.). We can clearly see there is something wrong with buildings aka “built environment” when it comes to climate. To respond to that, much of the attention being paid to green buildings is in new design construction. There are many different standards, like LEED and others, saying how to build well from the start. Source: Stonemark Construction Management That’s great but it’s not enough. About 66% of the buildings that exist today will still be there in 2050 and, although usually more sustainable in the long-term, new construction tends to generate higher emissions than retrofitting existing buildings. So what is retrofitting? It’s the process of modifying an existing building to make it more energy efficient. It’s mostly aimed at greatly reducing energy consumption in the first place by significantly improving the fabric of the building itself to increase its thermal performance and comfort. But many more things contribute to that goal: Switching to LED lights, installing solar panels, switching to an electric boiler, etc. The more you invest in retrofitting the better the energy efficiency label of your house will be Which leads to 2 main types fo retrofitting projects: Shallow retrofit: It’s quite superficial. It may include adding some insulation in the roof and having a more efficient boiler for example. Deep retrofit: Reduce energy use by at least 40%. Insulating some or all of your home including your walls, roof and floor and making sure the building is airtight. Upgrading windows and doors. Heat pump and mechanical ventilation heat recovery system installation. Etc. What are the benefits of retrofitting? Home value: Once you improve the energy efficiency of your home and receive a certification you will greatly improve the value and marketability of your home. Savings: The payback on retrofits, depending on the building, is 5 to 7 years on average. After that, it’s all huge savings. Jobs and emissions: Greenhouse gas emissions from existing buildings can be drastically reduced and millions of jobs will be created to do all of this retrofitting. Source: International Energy Agency Remember, building from scratch allows us to make houses extremely sustainable much more easily but there’s another more sustainable and crucial option: Retrofitting existing buildings. Challenges Knowledge: Most people are unfamiliar with retrofitting terms and techniques so they really don’t know where to start. It usually starts by asking friends and family who have gone through it, but not many have. Cost: Deep retrofits can cost over $70000 and Government incentives for retrofitting are not easily available in every country. Even though in the long-term it’s worth it, the upfront cost is really high. Inconvenient: The process usually involves a lot of bureaucracy, dealing with different companies for the different aspects of the project, and taking lots of time to make sure everything goes smoothly. Top Retrofitting Startups 💰 They have homeowners complete a digital survey, then give them an assessment of the energy status of their building, and suggestions on how to reduce their inefficiencies. They also take care of the appropriate subsidy applications for renovations. Source: Enter They have created a portal for green jobs that focuses on training/upskilling/reskilling people so they become skilled tradespeople that re-make our built environment to be energy efficient and drive down carbon emissions ASAP.

Heat always moves from warmer areas to cooler ones, until a temperature equilibrium is reached. This flow of heat can happen in 3 ways: Conduction: Heat flows through a material. The way a spoon placed in a hot cup of coffee conducts heat through its handle to your hand. Convection: Occurs when a liquid or gas, like air, is heated, becomes less dense, and rises. When it cools it becomes denser and falls. Radiation: Heat travels in a straight line away from any surface and heats anything solid that absorbs its energy. The Sun heating the Earth. Source: Let’s Talk Science This heat flow is key to keep buildings at a nice temperature. In the summer, hot air infiltrates indoor spaces, making air conditioners work a lot. In the winter, warm air escapes buildings, making heating systems work hard. Both of these increase your energy bill and your carbon footprint drastically. Instead of increasing our energy consumption to reduce that temperature gap we can just invest in better insulation for our homes! How does insulation work? Insulation works on a simple concept: It keeps the outside out and the inside in. It decreases this heat movement by providing an effective resistance to the flow of heat. It can consist of several different actions like: Choosing better building materials, installing double or triple pane windows, sealing gaps and cracks, adding layers of insulation on all sides (floor, exterior walls, and roof), etc. Source: Home Insulations And the best is we can measure this insulation improvement with something called the “R value”. The R value is the system of measurement for thermal resistance. The higher the R value, the more effective the insulation (extra resources about this at the end). Materials There’s a very wide range of insulating materials and every year even more come out. Some examples include: Fiberglass, polystyrene, cellulose, and natural fibers such as hemp, sheep’s wool and straw. We also have radiant barriers, which are layers of a highly reflective material that reflects radiant heat rather than absorbing it. Source: Constellation It is estimated that if 54% of existing residential and commercial buildings install insulation, 8 billion tonnes of emissions can be avoided at an implementation cost of $3.7 trillion. Net savings could be $2.5 trillion over 30 years and $4 trillion over the life-time of the insulation upgrade. So if we can save so much money and CO2 why aren’t we insulating like crazy? Challenges Cost: Even though you can start benefitting from smaller energy bills almost right after investing in insulation, it takes several years to cover the cost and the upfront investment can be quite high depending on the current state of your house. Inconvenience: It can be really inconvenient having workers at home during several days and dealing with the whole process. This of course depends on the extent of the insulation. In any case, it’s always better to do it before moving in or when building the house from scratch. Government incentives: In many countries Governments are not providing enough financial support to incentivize the insulation of buildings. In the cases where such support exists it can take very long until the owner receives the money. Top Insulation Startups 💰 They use mass thermal image capture to map how heat leaks in buildings and build retrofit plans.

Urban buses are the strongest example, based on miles and how inefficient the diesel models are“ - Ryan Popple (former Proterra CEO) Top Electric Buses News 🗞️ For the first time ever, in Q1 2023, sales of electric buses in the EU+UK were higher than those of any other type of bus. Source: International Council on Clean Transportation After a decade of support to EV manufacturers, the Chinese government will cut subsidies. Tax incentives will remain and even increase. Sales of EVs are shifting from policy-driven to market-driven. The US is electrifying its biggest transportation fleet: school buses. They just reached 1% of the total fleet being electric. Source: Canary Media Let’s dive in 🧠 The transportation sector overall is responsible for about 16% of global CO2 equivalent emissions. Out of that cars, SUVs and motorcycles are responsible for almost 50%! Source: International Energy Agency So why not just electrify all of those? We are doing it but, at the current rate it will be hard to access enough supply of lithium for that many cars. And even then, public transportation options are just much more sustainable for the environment because their emissions are spread out over a long period of time and split among the thousands of passengers that use them every day. Electric cars have no tailpipe emissions but their manufacturing emissions are really high and if the electricity they use comes from fossil fuels, they can be very dirty. Electrifying cars is not enough. We can have a much larger impact by electrifying buses and making them of better quality. This will get cars out of the road and will allow those who can’t afford to buy a car to be part of the energy transition. Let’s use lithium wisely… It takes almost 22x more lithium to build 40 electric SUVs than one bus that can move 40 people. Instead of those 40 SUVs, 960 kg of lithium could be used to build 22 electric buses that can move 880 people. Does it make economical sense to switch to eBuses? Yes. And here’s what matters to the municipal transportation officials, aka the clients… Over a typical 12 year life cycle, an electric bus saves between $73000 and $173000 over a diesel bus. That’s because eBuses have much lower maintenance costs since they have fewer parts and they also save a lot on fuel costs. Source: ResearchGate by Mohammadhossein Abbasi The only case in which it would not make economic or sustainability sense is if the fleet of diesel buses was just bought. In that case the best option might be to retrofit them, swap the diesel engine for an electric one. And btw, by electrifying all buses we will also get rid of those exhaust fumes that pollute our cities and kill over 4 million people each year according to the WHO. Electric buses make economic and environmental sense and they have already spread all over China… So why are they expanding so slowly all across the world? Challenges Operations: In some regions there is not enough infrastructure to charge the buses appropriately and the distances may be too big for the buses’ range with one charge. Cost: Even though in the long-term it’s more economic to have a fleet of electric buses, some companies just don’t want to pay so much upfront, especially when their diesel fleets are still quite new. That’s why China’s Government support was key to promote their expansion. Legislation: Although it’s changing, in many places there’s a lack of political leadership and public policy that promotes and supports the electrification of public transport fleets. Top Electric Bus Startups 💰 🇬🇧: They convert legacy diesel buses to electric ones. This is very smart and sustainable since they target fleets of buses that are 5-10 years old. It would make no sense to just throw away those relatively new buses and get electric ones, it’s better to retrofit them.

A group of researchers has achieved a 32.5% efficiency for a silicon-perovskite tandem solar cell. The record for traditional silicon PV cells is 26.81%. Efficiency of Silicon, Perovskite and Combined PV cells Source: Solar Builder The US Department of Energy launched a $3 million prize competition to promote the creation of viable perovskite solar businesses. Let’s dive in 🧠 Solar panels are critical in our path to net zero and even though they’ve become significantly cheaper, their efficiency hasn’t improved much. That’s going to change with perovskites. Perovskites are a special type of semiconductors. They exist in nature as a mineral made from calcium, titanium and oxygen (CaTiO3). Source: Forbes Since their discovery in the early 19th century we have developed many materials around perovskites but… Why are they so important for future solar PV cells? For that let’s understand how PV panels work. Typical solar cells essentially have 2 oppositely charged semiconductor layers stuck together forming a neutral zone. Ideally incoming photons of sunlight knock electrons out of the neutral zone and then the electrodes in the cell capture that as usable electricity. Nowadays that semicondutor material is silicon in over 95% of the panels worldwide. Source: Undecided with Matt Ferrell The efficiency of the solar cell drops a lot if there are defects in the material so the cells have to be heated at extremely high temperatures to get rid of the defects. This is a very energy intensive and expensive process. So what do perovskites bring to the table? Manufacturing advantages: They aren’t supply limited, like silicon. Production is more straightforward and requires 20 times less material. Thus leading to a smaller carbon footprint and a cost 16 to 40 times lower per square foot. Their structure is also more tolerant to defects than silicon. That eliminates the cost and high energy required to produce silicon cells. Higher efficiency (the amount of sunlight converted into electricity): Silicon-based solar panel efficiency is between 21% and 22%. The maximum silicon solar cells can reach is between 30% and 32%. This is known as the Shockley-Queisser limit. Perovskites can go beyond that (to around 40%). Flexibility: They absorb a wider range of wavelengths of light than silicon, which means more of the sunlight hitting the panel can be converted into electricity. Also, since they can be manufactured really thin, unlike the silicon layer, they can be used on all sorts of non-uniform surfaces that are currently economically unviable. Film-thin perovskite layer Source: PV Magazine Okay, so if the market is expected to grow at a 34% CAGR between 2020-2027 and the material’s efficiency has increased from 4% to 25% in a decade… Why isn’t it in every solar cell? Cons Durability: Perovskites are quite fragile. They still struggle to stand up to the 25 year warranty of a silicon cell. Oxygen, moisture and heat really damage them. Manufacturing: So far perovskite solar cells or solar cells that combine perovskite and silicon layers have mostly been produced in labs. Producing them at scale is still a challenge. Toxicity: Some of the materials used to protect the fragile perovskite layers are toxic (like lead), but other non-toxic materials are starting to be used. Top Perovskite Companies 💰 One of the leaders in the market. They have a flexible perovskite photovoltaic glass. In 2021 they launched the world’s first industrial production line of perovskite solar panels in Poland. Saule’s solar windows and blinds Source: Saule Technologies They are planning the commercial launch of a perovskite-on-silicon tandem cell this year, predicting a conversion efficiency of 27% and a plan to scale up production to 10GW by 2030. They make perovskite-silicon cells that work great even with artificial light or when it’s cloudy. They claim their PV cells have the lowest energy payback period.

Climate Tech Distillery,#23 Food Waste,Fixing the world's dumbest issue,"Read time: 5 minutes In this week’s issue you will learn about a very stupid problem that’s having a huge impact on climate change: Food Waste Source: Getty Images Subscribe to learn about climate tech topics explained in simple terms every week 🎉 Subscribe “Globally, if food waste could be represented as its own country, it would be the third largest greenhouse gas emitter, behind China and the US“ - United Nations Environment Programme Top Food Waste News 🗞️ Misfits Market acquired Imperfect Foods. They both source unwanted and excess groceries from farms and food producers selling them to customers for up to 40% off. The European Commission will propose legally binding targets to reduce food waste across the EU by the end of 2023. Nest founder Matt Rogers launched a subscription startup that makes trash cans that turn waste into compost. Source: Mill Let’s dive in 🧠 Some context about the issue Around 40% of all food produced is wasted. That’s 2.5 trillion kilograms of wasted food every single year. At the same time 1 in 10 people worldwide suffer from hunger. The total, annual amount of food that’s wasted across Earth is equal to four times the amount of food that could end world hunger with immediate effect. Just stop and think about that for a second. How is this affecting climate change? It takes a lot of resources to produce food, keep it cool and transport it. And when we throw it away because it goes uneaten it usually goes to a landfill. In the US 95% of discarded food ends up in landfills. There it decomposes and releases huge amounts of methane which is 80 times more effective than CO2, ton for ton, at trapping heat in the atmosphere in the 20 years after release. Btw, I covered the topic of methane :) Source: Community Emissions Data System We are messing up the planet to produce food no one ends up eating. Isn’t it ironic? Some more details about food waste The food waste value chain has several parts and around 60% of the waste takes place in households according to the UN. Source: Network for Business Sustainability Also, not all food is wasted equally. More expensive food tends to get wasted less, but at least in the case of meat it has a much larger carbon footprint. Source: Vox And here are some of the main reasons why we waste so much, especially in households: We buy stuff without knowing if we need it. Plate and fridge sizes and space to store food has increased significantly in the last few decades. Poor planning before buying and bad organization of the food (by expiration date) after buying it. But there’s good news! Of all the climate related challenges, food waste is one of the easiest to solve. And solving it will help mitigate climate change, reduce world hunger and help us save $940 billion of annual economic losses! So here are the three main ways to fix it: Better planning/forecasting: Supermarkets and restaurants can take advantage of analytics to keep their stocks as efficient as possible. Households can also do better scheduled meal plans and grocery shopping lists. Recovery: Connecting restaurants and supermarkets with buyers so they can get food they are about to throw away at a much lower price, or even donate it. Recycling: Using food waste to make bioplastics, energy, fertilizers, etc. So if it’s so easy why is it still such a big issue? Challenges Surplus food stigma: There’s a widespread misconception that surplus food is not safe for consumption when it’s actually perfectly fine to eat. Lack of knowledge: The fact that most waste occurs at households shows there’s a large say-do gap. We need to better inform people of the larger socio-environmental issues caused by food waste. Visibility: We need to avoid the mistakes of using large plates and portion sizes and placing fresh food at the back of the fridge. Supermarkets also have to make their “soon-to-expire” offers more visible. Top Food Waste Companies 💰 There’s so many, here’s a small map with a bunch of them.

Climate Tech Distillery,#22 Smart Grids,The green transition requires an updated grid,"Read time: 3 minutes In this week’s issue you will learn about the importance of the electric grid in reaching a net zero scenario: Smart Grids Source: Aiguasol Subscribe to learn about climate tech topics explained in simple terms every week 🎉 Subscribe “Investment in smart grids needs to more than double through to 2030 to get on track with the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 scenario” - IEA (International Energy Agency) Top News 🗞️ The Netherlands is switching to renewables and increasing electrification rates so fast that the grid is becoming overloaded. The same is happening in other countries. There’s a decade-long waiting list to build in West London due to constraints in the overstretched power grid. Let’s dive in 🧠 Let’s first take a look at what the electric grid looks like now vs what it’s going to look like in the future. Source: European Renewables Energy Association Today: Centralized production: A few big plants generate and distribute everywhere through huge wires at a huge scale. Siloed and fragmented energy assets. Sources: It’s not easy for consumers to know if their energy came from a clean source or not. In most cases it doesn’t. Consumption: The % of people who sell excess energy is very small. Future: Decentralized production: Every house, building, and even car can provide electricity to the grid. Energy plants are still needed but they are not as crucial. Sources: All energy will come from solar, wind, nuclear and other renewable sources. And people will know that’s the case. Source: IEA Consumption: Consumers consume and produce. They generate excess electricity they can sell to others. So what’s the issue? In order to get to Net Zero by 2050, besides doing other things, we need to do the following 2: Electrify: Many different industries are going to have to change how they operate in order to use electricity instead of fossil fuels (transport, cooling and heating, green hydrogen, etc.) Switch to renewables: The electricity to power this whole energy transition will have to come from renewables, otherwise we are still emitting CO2. Renewables are intermittent and we currently struggle a lot to store the energy they produce. This leads to problems such as the duck curve. The California “Duck Curve” showing net power demand going down during the day thanks to rooftop solar but going up in the evening due to newly electrified loads. Source: IEA There’s basically a mismatch between when we produce solar and when we need electricity the most. This leads to inefficiencies in the way utility companies provide electricity. What is a smart grid and how does it help? It’s like the normal grid but with a thick layer of digitalisation to improve efficiency and reduce waste. With individuals becoming “prosumers” by turning their houses into power plants, supply of electricity becoming more intermittent, demand increasing rapidly and demand for transparency on the rise, monitoring every aspect of the grid is key. We need to add many more sensors, information flows and security checks at every stage of the grid (generation, distribution and consumption). This will help with: Better matching between electricity supply and demand. Integration of smart devices to consume clean energy at the right time. Reduced power outages and grid overloading. Better inclusion of individual’s power generation assets. Real-time marketplaces of electricity in micro-grids between neighbors. And many more things! Of course, besides being more digital, the grid also needs to update its infrastructure (transmission lines, distribution centers, etc.) Cons So what’s keeping us from upgrading the grid? Heterogeneous market: Each geography has its own configuration, set of regulations, and constraints. Cyberattacks: The grid will be more prone to cyberattacks and thus the level of security needs to be drastically increased. Scale: A lot of money as well as coordination between Governments, companies and citizens is required to effectively implement the technology of smart grids. Top Companies 💰 Founded in 2016. They leverage blockchain to create products around energy trading and traceability, flexibility trading, and environmental commodities trading. Founded in 2020.

Source: EU Copernicus satellite China is leading the implementation of natural urban design to make its cities absorb water. Other countries are following. Wetlands used to be disregarded but luckily they are now starting to be given the importance they deserve in many countries’ and organizations’ policies. Let’s dive in 🧠 What are they? Wetlands are those areas where the water covers the soil all year long or during specific time periods. There are several types of wetlands (swamps, marshes, etc.) and they can be found all around the world. Source: Wetlands International But sadly they are disappearing at an alarming rate. ⅓ of the world’s wetlands have been lost in the last 50 years, a rate 3 times faster than forests. So why should you care? Because wetlands are awesome at fighting climate change and water issues. Here’s why they are awesome Carbon: Wetlands remove and store large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. They only cover 3% of the Earth’s land surface but store 30% of all land-based carbon. They are very good at capturing and storing carbon for 2 main reasons. Growth: Their plants usually grow a lot each year, and in the process, capture (or sequester) large amounts of CO2. Oxygen: Their soils have very little oxygen so carbon that gets incorporated into the soils decomposes very slowly and can persist for hundreds or even thousands of years (carbon storage). Water: They are hydrological buffers that limit floods, maintain water supplies in drought, help water to infiltrate soils, replenish underground water reserves, filter waste water, and sustain freshwater biodiversity. Source: Landscape DNA On top of all of this wetlands can be rehabilitated quickly, while a forest takes decades to grow and is more susceptible to destruction by fire. Why are they disappearing? Unsustainable development: Millions of hectares have been drained to provide land for housing, industry and agriculture. Pollution: 80% of our global wastewater is released into wetlands untreated. Pollution from factories, fertilisers, pesticides or from major spills all destroy wetlands. Climate change: Changes in rainfall and temperature makes them dry out. So now you know when we wetlands are destroyed we are losing a lot. We always talking about forests but we can’t forget about wetlands. Top Companies 💰 Luckily, there are companies and organizations working to protect wetlands. They are incentivizing the conversion of land into wetlands by connecting landowners and buyers of CO2 credits. They make environmentally-friendly water treatment technologies for the mining and oil and gas sectors in order to reduce the pollution that arrives to wetlands and other water bodies. They purchase vast amounts of land and then restore it and conserve it. They are the leading provider of investment capital for large-scale mitigation projects. ❗Extreme knowledge area❗ A cool way to see all the details about where wetlands are located around the world.

Climate Tech Distillery,#20 Wildfires,"Using climate tech to prevent them, detect them and stop them","Read time: 3 minutes In this week’s issue you will learn about one of the most destructive forces of nature and the different ways to deal with it: Wildfires Source: UN Environment Program Subscribe to learn about climate tech topics explained in simple terms every week 🎉 Subscribe “Climate change has already led to an increase in wildfire season length, wildfire frequency, and burned area“ - United States Environmental Protection Agency Top News 🗞️ A new VC fund has raised $35 million to invest in startups dealing with wildfires. Source: Convective Capital This week PG&E, XPRIZE, and several Government institutions have launched a four-year, $11 million competition to develop solutions against wildfires. Let’s dive in 🧠 Wildfires are any type of uncontrolled fire that is spreading across an ecosystem. They can start both in a natural way (lightning strike) or due to human activity (cigarettes, campfires, etc.). Sadly only about 4% of them start naturally, the rest are caused by humans either by accident or on purpose. Regardless of the cause, we see the number of wildfires has been growing drastically in the last few decades. (The picture shows the US only) Source: US Environmental Protection Agency One of the main reasons of this increase is climate change. With temperatures increasing every year, the evaporation rates go up, removing moisture from plants, the soil, and the dead branches and leafs. This means that if a fire starts it can spread very quickly. On top of that there’s evidence that climate change is affecting the jet stream and moving rain clouds from the areas that need them most. It’s also decreasing the amount of snow that keeps the forests green for a longer period of time. Source: IQAir Overall climate change is making the “wildfire season” last longer, be more unpredictable and more extreme. So what can we do? Prevention: Education: Increase awareness about the ways to prevent fires and the impact they have to limit the fires caused by accident. Maintenance: Properly manage forests, keep them healthy and get rid of dry dead branches. Make them less prone to catching on fire. Firewalls: Clear strips of forest or spray liquids that will keep fires from spreading. Source: Ecofire And of course, on top of that, there’s stopping climate change. The more we can limit the global temperature increase the more we will prevent fires from happening. Detection: The earlier a fire is detected the easier it is to put if off. In order to quickly detect fires in remote areas we can use several methods. There’s high definition near-real-time satellite images, smoke and humidity sensors placed in the forests, cameras places in strategic fixed spots or even in drones. Combining these ultra-early fire detection methods, allows firefighters to deal with wildfires as soon as possible. Extinction: Once the fire has started it is key to continuously monitor its evolution with as many types of cameras and sensors as possible. Source: NASA On top of that we can use special liquids to put off the fire more effectively than with water. Citizen cooperation and private-public partnerships are needed to effectively deal with wildfires. Cons Cooperation: The land wildfires burn often belongs to or falls under the responsibility of different people. This makes it more difficult to agree on how to deal with fires. Cost: Some of the solutions mentioned are not very cheap and they require to be deployed at a large scale, thus increasing the cost. This affects poor regions the most. Top Companies 💰 They make a 100% organic liquid that can be used both to put off a fire or to keep it from burning a certain area and thus acting as a firewall. 1 litre of Ecofire is the equivalent of 50 litres of water.

Climate Tech Distillery,#19 Bioplastics,Solving the huge plastic pollution problem,"Read time: 4 minutes In this week’s issue you will learn about the different natural alternatives we have to making petroleum-based plastics: Bioplastics Source: Notpla Subscribe to learn about climate tech topics explained in simple terms every week 🎉 Subscribe “The average person is now ingesting 5 grams of plastic a week“ - The World Wide Fund for Nature Top Bioplastics News 🗞️ We need viable pathways for recycling and composting bioplastics. Until then we won’t be able to make the most out of them. They won in the “Build a Waste-Free World“ category. The prize was started by Prince William’s Royal Foundation in 2020 and is now the world’s most prestigious environmental prize. Source: Angela Weiss/Getty Images The startup uses specialized bacteria to convert organic waste into biodegradable bioplastics that can be used to make everything from food packaging to clothing and textiles. Let’s dive in 🧠 Petroleum-based plastics started booming in the 1950’s because they were easy and cheap to produce and very versatile. Today there are 7 main types of plastic. Source: Plastics for Change All of them have one thing in common: they contain carbon. That carbon comes from refined oil, thus making them is a polluting process. But that’s not the main issue with plastics. It’s the fact that they hang around in the ecosystem for hundreds of years. Pieces of plastic float around the ocean causing all sorts of problems such as poisoning marine life. Plastics break down into smaller and smaller pieces and become microplastics that we end up eating. Source: Reuters One potential solution to this issue are bioplastics. What are they? Plastics made out of “biomass” like potatoes, sugar cane or algae instead of petroleum-based sources. Bio-plastics have a carbon footprint that’s 66% to 75% lower than that of petroleum-based plastics. Sadly they make up less than 1% of the total market for plastics nowadays. And here’s the trick, not all bio-plastics are biodegradable! Actually around 45% of bioplastics produced today are not biodegradable. And that’s an issue because if they are not biodegradable they can still clog up the oceans and accumulate in marine animals. Two very promising biodegradable bioplastic sources: Algae: Algae can be an awesome alternative to plastics. They are great because they are really oily, that’s why they can perform as well as petroleum-based plastics. Even though most bioplastics use sugarcane or potato, algae grows faster, takes much less space and requires less water than land plants. Some companies are now making flip-flops that fully biodegrade in a compost pile within six months. Even if they end up in the ocean, the algae-based flip flops will disappear in a year. Mycelium: Mycelium is another very promising alternative. This fancy word refers to the underground roots of fungi. Source: Fungi Perfecti It grows very quickly, in about a week you can have enough to fill a mould. Completely biodegradable. 90% CO2 equivalents reduction and only uses about 12% of the energy used by petroleum-based plastics. The process: You mix agricultural waste such as hemp or wood with mycelium. This mixture is placed into moulds for whatever you’re trying to make. Source: Very Compostable Sure, bioplastics can help mitigate plastic pollution but by far the best way to fight plastic pollution is to use less of it, bio-based or not. Cons Resources: The plants grown for producing bioplastics can have a significant land, water and carbon footprint. To replace all plastic packaging with bioplastics we would need 54% of the world’s corn production. Cost & Scale: Mycelium-based plastics can cost up to 3$ per pound vs 4¢ per pound for styrofoam (petroleum-based). Similar situations happen with other types. This happens because there is not enough mycelium and algae production. And it’s also difficult to scale the bioplastics production process. Degradability: We have to make sure all bioplastics are biodegradable and that’s not easy since in some cases we lack the infrastructure to take them to a composting site or they are simply not biodegradable. Top Bioplastics Companies 💰 The pioneers of mycelium-based products. Their materials are heat resistant, insulating, very strong, water-resistant, breathable and decompose in the soil within 35 days.

Climate Tech Distillery,#18 Air-Source Heat Pumps,Moving air heat to stay warm or cool,"Read time: 3 minutes In this week’s issue you will learn about a great way to save energy and money when heating and cooling your home: Air-Source Heat Pumps Source: Nu-Heat Subscribe to learn about climate tech topics explained in simple terms every week 🎉 Subscribe “Without action to address energy efficiency, energy demand for space cooling will more than triple by 2050” - International Energy Agency Top Air-Source Heat Pump News 🗞️ A recent study has debunked the myth that air-source heat pumps don’t work in cold weather conditions and that they are inefficient to run. In regions all around the world, like the UK, Spain or the US, air-source heat pump sales have surpassed those of gas furnaces. Source: Canary Media Let’s dive in 🧠 Some crazy stats to start: 50% to 70% of all energy used in homes goes towards heating and cooling. 15% of global carbon emissions comes from heating and cooling buildings. Cooling is the fastest growing use of energy in buildings. Hopefully, this shows why it’s so important to figure out how to decarbonize Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) in buildings. One potential solution are geothermal heat pumps, which I already covered . Today I’ll focus on air-source heat pumps. What are they and why are they so awesome? It’s a clean HVAC alternative that captures the heat from the ambient air and takes it out to keep your house cool or brings it in to keep it warm. Source: BC Hydro It’s becoming extremely popular because: In about 4 years you can get your money’s worth. They can be combined with solar PV to make the system even more sustainable. This is the best combo. They have a Coefficient Of Performance (COP) between 3 and 4. That means by providing 1 kW of electricity you can get up to 4kW of heat energy for your house. They help save a lot of money compared to other HVAC systems. Source: Nialls How do they work? In the air there is always some heat. Even if it’s really cold, there’s always some heat in the air. The heat pump extracts that heat from the air and moves it into the house or outside of it. Ideally this whole process is powered by renewable energy to make it even more sustainable. In the winter: The little heat in the cold air is captured by a refrigerant liquid present in the heat pump. The refrigerant warms up and turns into a gas that is then compressed and thus heated even more. That heat from the refrigerant gas is passed on to the water (air-water heat pump) in your house or to the air (air-air heat pump). Source: All Renewable Energy In the summer: The process is reversed. The hot air from the house is transferred outside through the refrigerant. The colder it is outside the harder it will be to capture the heat from the air and thus the more electricity will be consumed to power the process. Air-source heat pumps went from being unknown to now having some huge momentum. I really suggest you consider this as an alternative to AC and other HVAC options for your house. Cons Upfront cost: They are quite expensive to install and on top of that you need to add the installation of the heat dispersion method (radiators, radiating floors, etc.). Source: Carbon Switch Locations: It might not be the best option in places with extremely low temperatures (below -10ºC). It still works but in a less efficient way since lots of electricity is needed to make the system work. Aesthetics: The fan placed on the outside can be noisy and look bad on the facade of a building. Top Air-Source Heat Pump Companies 💰 Most of the big appliances companies like Haier or Mitsubishi make them. Here are three startups doing things differently: They are 100% vertically integrated and thus can create the perfect direct-to-consumer experience. Oh, and instead of spending 20k, you get their heat pumps on a subscription model where you pay just a little every month! Source: Aira From Belgium.

Climate Tech Distillery,#17 Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF),No longer feeling guilty about traveling by plane,"Read time: 4 minutes In this week’s issue you will learn about a way to massively reduce the emissions from air travel: Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Source: WSP Subscribe to learn about climate tech topics explained in simple terms every week :) Subscribe “SAF could contribute around 65% of the reduction in emissions needed by aviation to reach net-zero in 2050“ - International Air Transport Association Top SAF News 🗞️ Air Company fueled the first-ever test flight using 100% unblended sustainable aviation fuel made directly from CO2, conducted in partnership with the U.S. Air Force. Thanks to its environment-focused CEO, the airline is investing in SAF more than double the rest of the world’s airlines combined. Neste, by far the largest SAF producer, has helped helicopter manufacturer Bell complete its first flight fueled solely by 100% sustainable aviation fuel. Let’s dive in 🧠 Traveling by plane is awesome but sadly, if you take several flights a year, that’s BY FAR the largest contributor to your carbon footprint. The aviation industry accounts for 2% to 3% of global CO2 emissions. AITA (International Air Transport Association) has already drafted a plan to reach net zero by 2050, and at least 65% of getting there is going to happen thanks to SAF. Source: AITA So what is SAF? SAF includes many different fuels derived from non-fossil sources or ‘feedstock’. Nowadays the vast majority of SAF is made out of plants, used cooking oil, food scraps, solid municipal waste, and other types of solid waste. But, it can't be made from anything that: Diverts land use from food crops Consumes too much fresh water Destroys forests Because that's not sustainable. Source: Environmental and Energy Study Institute Why not just use electric planes or have them use hydrogen as fuel? Because electric only works for short distance and if you want to use hydrogen you need to change many parts of the plane for it to work properly. The good thing about SAF is you can use it in today’s planes, it’s “drop-in ready” as they say. How is it made? This will depend on the specific waste material used. But overall you need to collect the waste, purify it a lot, refine it, and turn it into fuel. All of this requires a lot of energy and transportation. Ideally all powered by renewables. It’s very difficult to make the whole process carbon neutral, that’s why, even though the raw material is some type of waste, SAF helps achieve around an 80% reduction in overall CO2 emissions. Source: IATA SAF made from CO2 Now there are several startups coming up with ways to use emitted CO2 as the raw material for making SAF! The way this works varies by company but the overall idea is this: Get CO2 from some place emitting high concentrations of CO2 (like a steel factory). Use renewables to produce green hydrogen from water with an electrolyzer. Mix the green hydrogen with the captured and distilled CO2. Source: Air Company Currently less than 1% of total fuel available is SAF. Nonetheless, airlines worldwide are investing in it and making partnerships with SAF producers which will boost its use and lower the price rapidly. Cons Scale: We currently produce hundreds of millions of litters per year and we need to produce tens of billions. Making SAF is quite a new and complex process so reaching the right scale will take time. Source: AITA Cost: IATA estimates SAF costs two to four times as much as any aviation fuel. Both Government support and making it available in more locations is needed. Energy: Producing SAF requires significant energy and it should come from renewables. The issue is we also need that renewable energy for many more things. Top SAF Companies 💰 All of these startups use captured CO2 as the raw material to make fuel. Their AIRMADE™ SAF offers the highest GHG emission reduction of any sustainable aviation fuel in the world. They have partnerships with Jet Blue, Virgin Atlantic, and the US Air Force among others. They produce E-Jet® with their electrochemical reactor and proprietary catalyst. They have partnerships with Alaska Airlines, Microsoft and others. They make aviation fuel and other types of fuel from CO2 captured from factories or directly from the open air . ❗Extreme knowledge area❗ Just in case that wasn’t enough, here are some cool additional resources to keep exploring the subject: All the details about how the International Air Transport Association will achieve net zero by 2050.

Climate Tech Distillery,#16 Hydropower,The most used source of renewable energy,"Read time: 4 minutes In this week’s issue you will learn about using the flow of rivers to produce electricity reliably: Hydropower Source: Blackridge Research Subscribe to learn about climate tech topics explained in simple terms every week 🎉 Subscribe “Hydro remains the largest renewable source of electricity, generating more than all other renewable technologies combined“ - International Energy Agency Top Hydropower News 🗞️ Droughts in several parts of the world led to a 0.4% decrease in 2021 despite the increase in capacity. It just opened in China, where the largest is also located. Source: Ember Yearly Electricity Data Let’s dive in 🧠 Hydropower is our main source of renewable energy, both in terms of installed capacity and electricity production. Source: International Energy Agency It’s about using flowing water. We started with mills used to grind cereals. Today we use turbines and generators to turn that flow into electricity. We have been building hydropower plants for over 140 years so there must be some reasons why we love this renewable energy source so much. Why is it so nice? Reliability: Compared to other renewables like wind and solar, hydropower is quite reliable as long as there is enough water in the rivers used. Price: Despite the high initial building costs, it provides one of the cheapest forms of renewable energy. Source: International Renewable Energy Agency Compatibility: Works well with other renewables since it can be used as base-load power, which means it provides the minimum amount of power needed and other renewables help to meet the spikes in demand. They way it works is quite simple, you get the flow of the river to move a turbine and with that you produce electricity. There are 2 main types of hydropower: Run of the river: Just a portion of the river is diverted so the flow of water can go through a turbine. It is more intermittent than dam hydro since it relies on natural water variability but it’s also better for the ecosystem since it barely affects the river and its wildlife. Source: Student Energy Dam: A lot of water is stored in a reservoir so when it goes through the dam it can move the turbines really fast. In some cases there is also a reservoir in the lower part, after the dam. Here, the water is stored to be pumped back up into the higher reservoir when it’s cheaper to do so. This is called pumped storage hydro. Source: Student Energy Most hydropower today comes from massive dam projects. These are great for regions with big rivers with enough gradient since they help produce a lot of energy but in many parts of the world that’s not the case. In such places micro-hydropower run of the river projects are the best since they require lower investment, they are better for the environment and they work on way smaller rivers. Cons Price: Building these projects is extremely expensive and many are on hold as costs of construction have gone up and it can take up to 10 years to build them! Environment: Changing wildlife habitats, blocking fish passage, forcing people in nearby communities to move somewhere else. Dam failures can be catastrophic claiming the lives of those living downstream. Area flooded to build the Three Gorges Dam (China) Source: NASA Water amounts: If there are severe droughts, there might not be enough water in the river to produce electricity. Also, those downstream from the dam can suffer from extreme water scarcity, since the little water available would be stored in the reservoir. It can also cause upstream flooding. All of these issues barely apply in the case of micro-hydropower run of the river projects. Top Hydropower Companies 💰 The massive projects are developed by huge electric companies together with governments. But here are two startups building much cheaper and smaller solutions for regions with not so ideal hydropower conditions. They make “vortex turbines” that work on very small rivers and do not disturb fish life. Great for small communities in remote areas. Source: Turbulent Their micro-hydro solution consists of a rotor attached to a platform. Both are placed on almost any type of river and produce electricity without damaging the ecosystem. ❗Extreme knowledge area❗ This dam located in China is the biggest power plant in the world.

It will produce 1 million kgs of leafy greens annually. Source: Emirates The high electricity costs since the invasion of Ukraine and the lack in funding have made many vertical farming companies shut down or downsize. The Kingdom will work with AeroFarms to build vertical farms in the country, across the Middle East and North Africa. Let’s dive in 🧠 Agriculture plays a big role in global CO2 emissions. Source: World Resources Institute And unless we do something about it, those emissions will only increase since the global population is set to surpass 9 billion by 2050. So we have to find a way to feed over 9 billion people in a sustainable way. That’s where vertical farms come in to help fix a part of the problem. What is it? Vertical farming is about growing food in a super efficient way. You get lots of plants and stack them vertically in layers, instead of horizontally, like it’s done on fields. You put them inside a building with an extremely controlled environment. Humidity, light, temperature, nutrients, etc. As much as possible is measured and controlled to grow plants in the fastest, most consistent, pesticide-free way. You provide the plants with the right amount of water, nutrients and light from LEDs. Source: Greenport West Holland This way you can get greens 365 days a year anywhere in the world! What does this achieve in terms of sustainability? It depends on the specific produce and brand but overall, compared to traditional agriculture, you get: 200% - 400% higher yield 98% less CO2 emissions 99% less land used 95% less water Plus, vertical farms can be placed in cities, so food doesn’t need to travel thousands of kms to where most people live. Types Hydroponics: The most used one. The plant roots are submerged in a nutrient-rich liquid solution. Gravel and sand support the roots, no soil is used. This allows the plants to take up the nutrients more easily. Aeroponics: This was started by NASA to grow plants in space. The roots are in the air and they get continuously sprayed with a nutrient-rich solution. It’s not the most common but it’s growing in popularity. Aquaponics: Very rare. Takes hydroponics and adds fish to the ecosystem. The fish add nutrients to the water which is then used by the plants. The plants clean the water and return it to the fish. Source: Ponicsarea Vertical farming just helps fix part of the problem because not all food can be grown this way. Biological viability: Many plants need actual natural outside conditions and space to grow properly. Economic viability: Even if the plants can be grown inside it can be too costly to do so. Vertical farming is great. Especially for regions with extreme weather conditions like the Middle East or countries with little arable land like Singapore. Such places need to import a huge % of their food, which is polluting, expensive, and provides very low food security. Still, a lot needs to improve in vertical farms and they’re not the best option for every food product or geography. Cons Variety: Only a limited number of plants can be grown economically. Mostly small leafy plants like lettuce since they grow quickly and require little space. Source: Infarm Costs: The industry is extremely vulnerable to increases in electricity prices since they use it 24/7. Unless renewables are used this also means an increased carbon footprint. Pollination: This is naturally and easily done in outdoor farms but the absence of pollinators in large vertical farms poses a challenge that can lead to poor production quality. Top Vertical Farms Companies 💰 The first indoor vertical farming company to be a Certified B Corporation. They grow 550 different varieties in their optimized aeroponic farms.

It would provide an inexhaustible supply of energy, without pollution or global warming.“ - Stephen Hawking Top Nuclear Fusion News 🗞️ Fusion used to be a public sector issue but now lots of companies are tackling it. The latest news from the world's largest nuclear fusion experiment. And all the info you need about this massive project in Southern France. Source: ITER An experiment got more energy out than the laser put in but this does not include the energy to make the whole process work. Let’s dive in 🧠 There are two types of nuclear energy: fission and fusion A fusion reactor replicates what happens naturally within the sun’s core. Instead of being split up, atoms get fused together and in the process a lot of energy is released. Source: VectorStock How does it work? There are many different approaches to nuclear fusion but here’s the most common one. You get hydrogen isotopes (deuterium and tritium). Isotopes are just like the normal hydrogen atoms but a bit different in their structure. You put them in a doughnut-shaped chamber (tokamak) where they are heated up to 150 million Celsius. At this temperature the atoms are stripped off of their electrons and you are left with plasma. In order to contain the plasma you use super powerful magnets. The particles collide and fuse together, just like in the sun. When they fuse they form helium and they release a lot of thermal energy in the process. The thermal energy is then used to turn water into steam and to turn a turbine really fast. The turning of the turbine generates electricity and it goes into the grid where we can use it. (Tokamak Inside) Source: Popular Mechanics The point is to get atoms so hot that they fuse together and release a lot of energy. To get there we can use lasers, magnets, reactors of different shapes, different chemical elements, etc. Why is fusion so awesome? Low radioactivity: The byproducts of the reaction have very low radioactivity levels and they disappear rather quickly. Perfect fuel: We can get deuterium from seawater and you can get tritium in the nuclear reaction itself. Really abundant, clean, and extremely energy dense fuel. Source: LaRouchePAC Not a bomb: Fusion reactors can’t explode. There’s no chain reaction that can get out of control because the fusion stops if you switch it off or if you stop supplying fuel. Consistency: Unlike other renewables, this energy could work 24/7 and be plugged into the grid easily. The goal with fusion is to achieve Q>1. That means more power generated from the reaction than used. The current record is at 0.7 and it only lasted for 4 billionths of a second. But to produce more electricity than it takes to run the whole process we need a Q value somewhere between 10 and 25! Source: Get Into Nuclear Cons Difficulty: Figuring it out is extremely complex. There’s a joke around fusion that says ""fusion is 30 years away and it always will be”. Cost: Building fusion reactors is extremely expensive given the really rare materials used, infrastructure, massive energy consumption, suppliers, etc. Legislation: You can imagine all the permits required to build fusion reactors. Especially given the bad reputation any type of nuclear has in some countries. Top Nuclear Fusion Companies 💰 They are developing economical micro fusion power packs the size of a lunch pail. Source: Avalanche They use a new high temperature superconductor to build smaller and lower-cost fusion reactors.

Climate Tech Distillery,#13 Tidal Power,"A source of accessible, natural and consistent clean energy","Read time: 4 minutes In this week’s issue you will learn about turning the movement of the tides into electricity: Tidal Power Source: The Cool Down Subscribe to learn about climate tech topics explained in simple terms every week 🎉 Subscribe “Ocean energy technologies are expected to make a significant contribution to Europe’s energy system and industry as from 2030“ - European Commission Top Tidal Power News 🗞️ The wave and tidal energy market is projected to reach $29 billion by 2030 and it was only at $1.2 billion in 2022. Here’s an overview of the most significant tidal projects by region. The EU is leading with 17 projects in progress. The US Department of Energy will spend $35 million in funding tidal and river current projects. Such investments are also increasing in the EU, China and other markets. Let’s dive in 🧠 This is about placing turbines in the sea to take advantage of the movement of the tides when they go up or down. The movement of such turbines is then converted into electricity. Wind are solar are great but tidal power has several awesome aspects those renewable sources don’t have: Consistency: The best about tidal power is that it’s very predictable. We know when tides come in and when they go out. The same can’t be said about wind or solar. This makes adding energy to the grid easier, the same can’t be said about intermittent renewables like wind and solar. Source: Size: Water is 800 times denser than air so tidal turbines need to be more resistant than wind turbines. But they can also be smaller and slower yet still produce as much power or even more than wind turbines. Landscape: They don’t impact the view of the landscape either, which is usually an issue with wind and solar projects. Just a reminder, the tides are caused by the gravity pull of the moon and the sun and the rotation of the Earth, that’s why they are so consistent. Source: Shutterstock Now let’s get more specific with the two main types of tidal power. Range: 98% of tidal energy today comes from this type. You place a dam close to the shore (where the effect of tides is felt the most) and wait until there is a big difference in water altitude between both sides. Then you open the doors at the bottom and let the water move the turbines. Sources: Undecided with Matt Ferrell, Offshore Energy Stream: It’s not very popular yet but it’s the one with the coolest projects. No need to build massive dams that disrupt the environment. The turbines take advantage of the currents created by the tides. They can be fixed to the ocean floor, floating so they can be moved around, or even be kind of like a kite that’s fixed to the floor but moves under the ocean. Sources: Renewables Now, Offshore Wind, CNBC Sounds great, right? So why is tidal power so small compared to other renewables? Cons Location: There needs to be at least a 5 meter difference between the low and the high tide. Large populations should be close and it should be easy to connect the turbines to the grid. Source: Nova Innovation Environment: The infrastructure required can damage the local fauna, flora, and soil. It can also disturb nearby populations and fish species may get displaced to avoid those areas. Price: It’s a very small industry and everything that’s underwater is more challenging and expensive (installation, maintenance, etc.). $130-$280 per megawatt-hour vs $20 per megawatt-hour for wind according to a 2019 study. Top Tidal Power Companies 💰 Here are three of different types of tidal power. Their subsea kite swipes a turbine at a speed several times the actual speed of the underwater current.

Climate Tech Distillery,#12 Enhanced Weathering,Accelerating nature's carbon capture process,"Enhanced weathering is about accelerating the natural process through which the Earth regulates atmospheric levels of CO2. Weathering just means breaking down rocks via chemical, biological, or physical processes. Ex: Rain, wind, plants, etc. How does this natural process work? Source: Vesta CO2 in the atmosphere mixes with the water in the rain forming carbonic acid. When the drops reach the Earth’s surface the carbonic acid reacts with the rocks. Continuous rainfall dissolves the rocks into smaller components (chemical weathering). The components eventually get transported into the ocean by rivers and groundwater. Once there, they react with the CO2 in the ocean and make very stable formations such as shells, corals, rocks, etc. The issue with this process is that it takes thousands of years. We have accelerated the natural process of putting CO2 in the atmosphere way too much in the last few decades. Source: NASA So we also need to accelerate the speed of removing it. And of course we have to stop emitting even more. How does the enhanced process work? By spreading finely ground powder of rocks on beaches and fields. Rocks rich in calcium, magnesium and iron, which react very well with CO2. A mineral called olivine or rocks such as volcanic basalt are great examples since they are far more reactive and help capture CO2 much faster than average rocks. Spreading powder of such rocks not only helps capture CO2 in decades instead of thousands of years. It also helps: Lower ocean acidification rates. Fertilize by providing nutrients to plants in fields. These rocks are really abundant in nature but getting them can be expensive and energy intensive. We can also use rocks with similar properties that come from industrial processes’ waste or old mines. Btw, enhanced weathering has the most potential in tropical regions since it rains a lot there, which is key for the process. Source: World in Maps Cons Cost: Using waste rocks would be cheap (around $10 per tonne) but there’s not that much waste to be used. Freshly mined rocks would cost $50 to $200 per tonne. Logistics: Getting the rocks, crushing them, transporting them and spreading them in the right places requires lots of players coordinating at a massive scale. Impact: Measuring the carbon being removed is not easy. Plus, we don’t know the exact effects each type of rock would have on each type of soil, which is a big deal for agriculture. Top Enhanced Weathering Companies 💰 They’re adding a carbon-removing sand made of crushed olivine to eroding coastal systems. It reduces ocean acidity and removes carbon dioxide permanently. Source: Vesta They spread basalt on croplands and use software to maximize CO₂ removal while boosting crop growth. They spread rock powder on agricultural land in the tropics to capture CO2 and regenerate tropical soils. This way they contribute to more sustainable farming. ❗Extreme knowledge area❗ Just in case that wasn’t enough here are some additional resources: This is the most famous enhanced weathering project so check out this video to know about their pilot project.

Climate Tech Distillery,#11 Carbon Capture Storage (CCS),Taking emitted CO2 back underground.,"Even if we move to renewables and decarbonize the whole economy we will still need to take already emitted CO 2 out of the atmosphere. Source: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration We are at 421ppm, we need to get back down to a safe level of around 300ppm. After removing that CO 2 from the air we can either store it or use it to make stuff. The second option is called Carbon Capture Utilization (CCU) and I already covered it :) Let’s focus on CCS now There are many ways to store CO 2 . Trees are the most common one, but they can burn or be cut down. There’s also the ocean, beaches, mountains, etc. Those are all nature-based solutions and they are awesome. But when we speak of CCS we usually refer to this: Source: Global CCS Institute The process can be simplified into 3 main steps. Capture the emissions: From a heavy industry facility that releases lots of CO 2 . Most carbon capture technologies aim to stop at least 90% of the CO 2 from reaching the atmosphere. Transform and transport: Extract just the CO 2 , liquify it and move it to where it’s going to be stored. By liquifying it, CO 2 takes up much less space when stored underground. Source: IEA Store: Keep it a few kms underground where the high temperature and pressure will make it stay in this “supercritical fluid” state (a mix between liquid and gas). These are the main underground formations for geologic carbon storage: Saline formations Basalt formations Unmineable coal deposits Oil and natural gas reservoirs Organic-rich sedimentary rocks REMEMBER: REDUCING IS THE PRIORITY, but removing is also necessary. If this sounds so great, how come there are only 30 commercial CCS facilities in operation? Source: CCS Institute Cons Misusage: Some companies are using CCS as an excuse to keep polluting instead of investing in fixing the actual source of emissions. Money: Currently the cost of emitting carbon is lower than the cost of capturing it, so it’s not worth it for companies to do CCS. It depends on the specific case but CCS costs hundreds of euros per tonne and EU carbon permits are trading under 100 euros. Source: Trading Economics Scaling: CCS is quite complex and requires lots of infrastructure. We are currently capturing and storing an average 40 million tonnes of CO 2 per year and we have to get to around 5600 by 2050! Top CCS Companies 💰 Here’s a mix of companies from the whole CCS value chain. They turn CO 2 into stone underground in less than 2 years. They focus on the storage part of CCS and rely on partnering with companies that send them the captured CO 2 . They’re from Iceland and they have raised $117 million. Source: Carbfix They are by far the largest company in the world. After sucking the CO 2 directly from the atmosphere they send it to partners like Carbfix to store it. They’re Swiss and they have raised $800 million. They provide CCS As A Service. Since the CCS value chain is so complex they help companies by taking care of the whole process. They charge per tonne of captured CO 2 . They’re from Norway and their market cap is $860 million.

Climate Tech Distillery,#10 Sustainable Fertilizer,Reducing hunger and pollution at the same time,"In order for plants to grow they need water, sunlight, many minerals, and especially NITROGEN. Source: Johann Dréo They get nitrogen in a natural way, but in order to make plants grow even more and increase their yield we started adding nitrogen to them. Most plants can’t make their own nitrogen; instead, they get it from ammonia in the soil. For centuries we fertilized plants in a natural way, with manure or bird guano (poop), which contain a lot of ammonia. Guano is mostly obtained from small islands in Latin America like this one: Source: Worldatlas.com That wasn’t very scalable and in 1908 Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch figured out how to make ammonia in a factory by applying heat and pressure to hydrogen and nitrogen. Thanks to them the global population grew massively. We could now get much more food from plants. How we make fertilizer today is based on their invention. The issue is it’s quite polluting in several ways. Source: Fertilizers Europe We need to burn natural gas to get hydrogen. Use fossil fuels to power the process to mix it with nitrogen. Transport the ammonia and the fertilizer around with fossil fuel powered vehicles. And finally, waste it when using it. Sadly, over 50% of the fertilizer applied to plants never gets absorbed. Instead it flows to the water and pollutes it or goes into the air in the form of nitrous oxide (N2O), which is extremely polluting. Source: Climate Central Ammonia is the second most produced chemical in the world and about 80% of it is used to make fertilizer. Altogether fertilizer production is responsible for about 2.5% of global CO2 equivalent emissions. The fertilizer issue has 2 parts: The production and transportation of ammonia and thus fertilizer. The waste and pollution of fertilizer when it’s applied. The first issue can be solved by using renewable energy to power the process/transportation and instead of hydrogen from natural gas to produce ammonia. Source: Fertilizers Europe The other issue is harder to fix. We would need to have sensors monitoring the level of nitrogen plants get, so we reduce the waste. But that’s expensive and since fertilizer is so cheap farmers don’t mind wasting it. Or we could find other ways to make plants absorb nitrogen more easily. That includes: taking care of the soil, modifying the crops, adding microbes that help naturally fix ammonia to the roots, using more natural fertilizers, etc. Pivot Bio’s microbes help plants absorb nitrogen from the air Besides this, changing our diets would also make a huge impact since eating less meat would mean growing way less crops and thus using less fertilizer. But that’s a whole other issue. Cons Green Hydrogen: You can check all the cons about green hydrogen I covered in another . Volume: It’s such a huge and well-established industry that changing it will require scaling sustainable solutions a lot. Costs: Today’s fertilizer is cheap, especially in some parts of the world where sustainable alternatives would be too expensive. There needs to be some policy support until sustainable alternatives reach the right price. Top Sustainable Fertilizer Companies 💰 There are many ways to produce sustainable fertilizer. Here’s a mix: Their units are installed in farms to convert livestock manure into sustainable fertilizer with air and electricity. The methane and nitrous oxide are trapped in the unit. Source: N2 Applied They make microbial nitrogen fertilizers. These microbes help plants absorb nitrogen that’s naturally present in the air, thus avoiding any type of greenhouse gas emissions. They combine ammonia from waste water, captured carbon dioxide from industrial power generation, and organic residues to produce sustainable fertilizer. ❗Extreme knowledge area❗ If you think this wasn’t enough here are a few more links to dig deeper.

Climate Tech Distillery,#09 Geothermal Energy,Using the heat beneath our feet,"Read time: 4 minutes In this week’s issue you will learn about a renewable energy source that’s great for producing electricity and the best for heating: Geothermal Energy Source: Chariot Energy “Just 0.1% of the Earth’s total heat content could meet our energy needs for two million years” - Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy Top Geothermal Energy News 🗞️ The Department of Energy (DOE) has announced $15 Million to drive down costs of geothermal drilling. The goal is to power at least 40 million American homes with renewable geothermal power by 2050! The festival organizers have sued the US Government to stop the development of a geothermal energy project in northern Nevada. The EU innovation fund will finance the first commercial-scale implementation of innovative closed-loop geothermal technology. Let’s dive in 🧠 Solar and wind are great but since they require storage, many companies are still looking for other energy generation options like geothermal. It’s the energy generated and stored inside the Earth (we don’t drill past the crust). Source: Discover Magazine That heat inside the Earth can be used for 2 things: Generating electricity ⚡ There are several ways to do this but the principle is pretty much the same for all of them: Drill between 2 and 5 kms deep. (The center is 6300kms deep) Access a hot water reservoir (a couple hundred degrees) or create one by pumping water down there. Get that hot water to come back up and turn into steam to power a turbine or use it to heat another liquid with a lower boiling point which is then used to power a turbine as well. Get the electricity generated from the turbine to the grid. Source: Energy.gov This is the most common type nowadays. Due to the change in pressure the hot underground liquids turn into steam and power a turbine. Geothermal might not always beat solar or wind in terms of costs to generate electricity, since it depends a lot on the location. Heating’s a different story… Heating 🔥 Geothermal can be used to heat buildings much more cost-effectively and directly than any other renewable energy source. This is key since between 50% and 70% of all energy used in homes goes towards heating and cooling. Here’s where geothermal heat pumps come in. Source: Dandelion Energy They are systems of tubes and a heat exchanger located just a couple meters underground. They take advantage of the constant temperature of the soil to keep your house warm in the winter and cold in the summer. All of this is great but we are still using very little geothermal energy. Source: Visual Capitalist And if we want to meet our Net Zero targets we need much more… So if geothermal has so much potential to help decarbonize the economy why are we struggling to use it more? Cons Location: Most geothermal energy plants today are located in tectonic plates’ boundaries where hot water comes out more easily. Source: Visual Capitalist To get really hot temperatures in places which are not in such places you need to drill much deeper. That’s why the countries in the “Ring of Fire” area have so much geothermal energy potential. Costs: Exploring the terrain, drilling and setting up the whole infrastructure is costly. Once the plant is built it’s quite cheap and efficient to run. Earthquakes: It’s very rare but some types of geothermal drilling can cause earthquakes. These cons do not apply to geothermal heat pumps :) Top Geothermal Energy Startups 💰 A US startup that used to be part of Alphabet and is now independent. They replace air conditioning and heating equipment with a heat pump that keeps the house warm in the winter and cold in the summer. They have created a new approach to drilling, that’s 90% cheaper, can reach deeper, can stand higher temperatures, and is more sustainable than any other method. They use millimetric electromagnetic waves to pulverize the rock.

Climate Tech Distillery,#08 Green Hydrogen,A really versatile clean fuel that will be key to decarbonize the economy,"Hydrogen is very rarely found freely in nature, it’s usually combined with other elements. The best example is water, H2O. That’s why the most common way to produce green hydrogen is through electrolysis. It’s a process where you split H2O into hydrogen and oxygen by using electricity. Source: International PtX Hub If the electricity used comes from renewables you get green hydrogen. But hydrogen is not always produced this way. The color changes depending on how clean the way to produce hydrogen is. That’s where the hydrogen rainbow comes in. Source: Técnicas Reunidas The vast majority of it today comes from using natural gas (grey hydrogen). And only about 1% of total hydrogen production was green in 2021. Let’s focus on green hydrogen. Why is it so important? The sweet spot for green hydrogen is where electricity will not be able to provide the solution. For example: Heavy transport ships and long distance flights: For these it’s not feasible to use batteries, instead we can use fuel cells which are basically batteries running on hydrogen and oxygen. Source: Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Association Steel production: Check out what I wrote about that . Fertilizer: We use a lot of it. To make it we need hydrogen and ideally that hydrogen should be green. Here’s a great way to visualize the whole green hydrogen process. Source: The World Bank So yes, green hydrogen is an awesome way to decarbonize several sectors. It’s really versatile and it can be stored, which is great to use it as a fuel and it can also be turned into products derived from hydrogen such as ammonia and methanol. And water is the only byproduct of using green hydrogen! But it has some issues… Cons Storage: Lots of storage needs to be built. Hydrogen has a low energy density. You need about 3 times as much space to store the same amount of energy compared to natural gas. Renewables are scarce: Using them to make hydrogen instead of using them directly might not be the best option. Price: Electrolizers are still expensive but they are getting cheaper. Top Green Hydrogen Companies 💰 All the major energy companies like , , , etc. are getting into green hydrogen projects. Besides there are many startups working on green hydrogen solutions.

Climate Tech Distillery,#07 Carbon Capture Utilization (CCU),Using CO2 from the air instead of fossil fuels to make products,"CCU is about getting CO2 from the atmosphere and turning it into something useful. This solves 2 huge issues at once. Stop adding new CO2: A LOT of things we use are made with fossil fuels or petrochemicals in some way (plastics, fuels, steel, etc.). If we use emitted CO2 to make these products instead, they become carbon neutral or even carbon negative. Remove emitted CO2: Even if we stop producing CO2, we still need to remove a lot that we have already emitted in order to get back to healthy atmospheric CO2 levels. Source: International Energy Agency There are many ways to capture CO2, such as . After being captured it can be stored (Carbon Capture Sequestration, CCS) or used (Carbon Capture Utilization, CCU). Let’s focus on CCU. Once CO2 is captured, the molecule needs to be transformed into other molecules such as Carbon Monoxide (CO) or Oxygen (O2) that can be used by different industries to make stuff. There are several ways to do this but currently the most common one is by using electricity and some chemical elements that make the reaction happen. Those basic molecules can then be used to make all sorts of stuff! Here are some cool examples: Vodka: It’s basically pure ethanol, which contains carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. Air Company has found a way to make vodka from captured CO2 so you can enjoy an “Airtini”. Source: Air Company Diamonds: They are pure carbon, so Aether Diamonds is using captured CO2 to make them. The first carbon-negative diamonds, 20 tons of CO2 per carat sold. Concrete: CarbonCure is injecting CO2 into concrete while it's mixing, which enables a reduction in the carbon footprint while maintaining the concrete's strength and performance. Chemicals: D-CRBN has created the cheapest and most efficient way to turn CO2 into carbon monoxide (CO), which can be used or transformed into chemicals used in many industries. They separate CO2 with plasma instead of chemicals! Source: D-CRBN There are many more ways captured carbon can be used. CCU has huge potential to help fix climate change because it gives companies new revenue streams, helps them be compliant with emissions regulations and makes customers like them more. It makes ethical, economical and regulatory sense to use CCU. Cons They are just challenges. Cost: Most CCU today requires rare-earth elements for the chemical reaction, which are expensive. There are now cheaper ways such as D-CRBN’s plasma. Source: D-CRBN Energy: The process usually requires a lot of electricity, that’s why making sure it comes from clean sources is key. Top CCU Companies 💰 There are now many startups raising millions and having huge companies wanting to partner with them to help them decarbonize. NY based, founded in 2018.

Climate Tech Distillery,#06 Offshore Wind,The untapped potential or harnessing the wind at sea,"Read time: 3 minutes In this week’s issue you will learn about a renewable energy source at the early stage of expansion but with massive growth potential: Offshore Wind Source: Ørsted ""As yet, the wind is an untamed, and unharnessed force; and quite possibly one of the greatest discoveries hereafter to be made, will be the taming, and harnessing of the wind."" - Abraham Lincoln Top Offshore Wind News 🗞️ They plan to add 30 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind energy by 2030 and 15 GW of floating offshore wind energy by 2035. That’s over 80% of the global installed capacity in 2021. In 2021 the country built more offshore wind power capacity than the rest of the world combined. Source: Global Wind Energy Council Let’s dive in 🧠 Wind power is the second largest source of renewable energy. But if we look closer we can see there are two main types: Onshore and offshore. Onshore has been known for a really long time whereas the first offshore wind farm was not built until 1991. That’s why 93% of wind installed capacity in 2021 was onshore. But offshore is growing rapidly and has huge potential… Source: International Energy Agency Offshore wind is awesome for 3 main reasons: Wind speeds: Winds blow way faster at sea than on land which means more energy can be generated. Wind steadiness: The main issue with wind and solar is they are intermittent energy sources. The good news is that at sea there is almost always wind, that’s not the case on land. Landscape obstruction: Onshore projects get blocked because not many want them on their backyard, they obstruct the landscape and are noisy. At sea that’s not an issue and we can make them as big as we want. Making them bigger is key since the power generated increases exponentially with the blade size. Area swept by the blades = π x blade length squared If we dig even deeper we see there are 2 types of offshore wind: Fixed and floating. The further away from the coast, the stronger and more steady winds are but also the deeper the ocean is. Until now we didn’t know how to make wind turbines float so we had to install them in “shallow” areas and fix them to the ocean floor. That’s why the vast majority of offshore is fixed. But floating is much better: Energy generation: Since they are further out at sea they get much more wind and generate more electricity. Locations: We can install them in areas that were previously inaccessible with fixed offshore turbines. Countries like Spain, where the ocean is very deep close to the coast will benefit a lot from floating offshore wind. Source: Wikipedia Ecosystem preservation: They don’t mess with the ocean floor so much and their installation process is less aggressive. In summary: Floating offshore > Fixed offshore > Onshore Cons Nature: Impacts on marine wildlife need to be considered. Price: Offshore is currently more expensive to build, install, maintain, etc. Distance: The further out at sea the more difficult it is to transport the electricity generated to where it’s needed. Locations: The ocean is full of commercial routes, natural protected areas, fishing zones, military drills, etc. Planning where to put the farm is be challenging. Top Offshore Wind Companies and Projects 💰 Here’s a mix of top companies and projects so you can have better offshore wind conversations. Main companies: (Denmark), (Denmark), (US), (Spain), (China). It’s located on Norway’s coast and even though it’s small, it is a big landmark for floating offshore wind projects. It’s located on the UK’s coast and it will help power 1.3 million UK homes. Will be built between China and Taiwan and will be able to power the equivalent of all of Norway. Still years away from being done. ❗Extreme knowledge area❗ Here’s a great video that explains the design and engineering behind floating wind turbines. Here’s the Global Offshore Wind Report 2022.

In their latest mission they have pinpointed where methane leaks are coming from and provided insight to quickly address them. Source: NASA China is the largest methane emitter yet it hasn’t joined the pledge, already signed by 150 countries, to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030. Let’s dive in 🧠 After CO2, methane (CH4) is the second most abundant man-emitted greenhouse gas. Yet nobody talks about it… Here are the main differences between these gases: CO2: • Stays in the atmosphere for centuries. • Traps a smaller amount of heat consistently, decade after decade. Methane (CH4): • 200 times less abundant than CO2. • Stays in the atmosphere for about20 years. • Does its damage quickly but soon fades away. Because its powerful and short-lived compared to CO2, large reductions would have a rapid and significant effect on climate change Source: Community Emissions Data System Which are the main sources of man-made methane emissions? Agriculture: Wetlands: Due to the microbial activity methane is produced. Rice fields are huge man-made wetlands. Ruminants: Cows, sheep, goats and other ruminants produce methane due to their unique digestion process Source: UN FAO Landfills: Methane is a natural byproduct of the decomposition of organic material in landfills. Oil and Gas: FYI methane is the main component in natural gas. The fossil fuel industry emits methane in 3 main ways: “Fugitive emissions”: Leaks that are not intended happen in gas pipelines, oil rigs, natural gas plants, etc. They hurt the planet and cost companies millions. “Vented emissions”: Intended emissions usually due to safety issues such as maintenance of the infrastructure. “Incomplete flaring”: Natural gas that cannot be used is burned instead of being sold or vented. The vast majority of the natural gas is converted into CO2 and water, but some portion may not be burnt and is released as methane. Source: International Energy Association Reducing methane is a low-hanging fruit. One of the cheapest, fastest, and easiest ways to stop climate change. Solving it gives us more time to fix the other issues with CO2. The International Energy Agency estimates we could reduce methane emissions from oil and gas by 75% by 2030 using existing technology. And 40% could be basically free! As easy as tightening a bolt or closing a valve. Why aren’t we tackling the problem? Sanctions: Until recently none of these leaks or careless methane emissions were sanctioned so companies didn’t care. Knowledge: Methane is colorless and odorless so many companies don’t even know how much is leaking. You need special equipment that can pick up infrared radiation of methane’s wavelength. (Camera to detect methane) Source: DW Planet A Money: Some companies prefer investing in activities that bring shorter term profits and some also lack the infrastructure to deal with the problems. Top Methane Companies 💰 One for each the main methane issues :) They have created really small satellites that can detect methane leaks with amazing detail from really far distances. They tell the emitters so they can reduce leaks to save money and emissions. They install devices in landfills to collect methane emissions and send the gas to treatment plants. Their system captures 50,000 metric tons per year at a single project. They grow a specific type of algae and turn it into a food supplement for cows. This reduces the cows’ methane emissions by over 90%.

Climate Tech Distillery,#04 Carbon-Neutral Cement,Decarbonizing the main building material to eliminate 8% of global CO2 emissions,"Read time: 4.5 minutes In this week’s issue you will learn why cement is so polluting and how to decarbonize it: Carbon-Neutral Cement Source: CarbiCrete “I n the time it takes you to read this sentence, the global building industry will have poured more than 19,000 bathtubs of concrete.” -The Guardian Top Carbon-Neutral Cement News 🗞️ It’s a very prestigious international prize for architecture. The co-founders of Seratech won this year for making carbon-neutral concrete. In 2021 the Global Cement and Concrete Association launched its 2050 Cement and Concrete Industry Roadmap for Net Zero Concrete. Some parts are questionable but it’s better than nothing. Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures $2 billion fund has invested in 3 cement startups. Many more climate tech funds are also investing in this sector. Let’s dive in 🧠 We produce over 4 billion tonnes of cement a year, responsible for almost 8% of global CO2 emissions. Cement is one of the elements that make up concrete (the second most used resource in the world after water). 10% cement, 20% air and water, 30% sand, and 40% gravel = concrete While there are some environmental issues with the other elements as well, cement is by far the most polluting one. Here’s how cement is made: Grind up limestone aka (CaCO3), mix it with other elements in a rotating kiln at 1500ºC. 1 tonne of cement = 1 tonne of CO2 Source: Just Have A Think Here’s where the emissions come from: 50% from the chemical reaction. CaCO3 → CaO + CO2 40% from burning fuel to create the reaction. 10% other elements in the supply chain The last two can be dealt with by making the supply chain more efficient and by using renewables and clean fuels to power the process. The big problem is the chemical reaction. The good news is that now we have a bunch of companies working on ways to avoid or compensate for the emissions from that reaction. Here are some really cool ones: Using other rocks instead of limestone: We use limestone because it has calcium but other rocks like basalt also have calcium and don’t produce CO2 when they react. Such rocks are know as calcium silicates. They are 100x more abundant than limestone. Inject CO2 into concrete: Inject CO2 into concrete while it's mixing, which enables a 4-6% reduction in the carbon footprint while maintaining the concrete's strength and performance. Source: CarbonCure Don’t use cement to make concrete: Instead of using cement, some companies are using “steel slag” which is a leftover byproduct of making steel. It is mixed with the other materials and binds perfectly to create concrete. Use nature: Some companies are taking advantage of biological options to make cement. For example using limestone that was grown by algae through photosynthesis, rather than limestone that was mined from the earth. Source: University of Colorado Capture emissions: Another very popular option is to capture the emissions that come from making cement and storing them underground/using them somewhere else. If done right it’s great but there’s room for bad practices and it does not solve the root issue, the chemical reaction. Source: Financial Times The technology is there. Many companies are coming up with great solutions and scaling them. So why aren’t they everywhere? Cons Money: Both governments and big companies need to to start seriously investing in carbon neutral cement to make it more economically attractive. Tradition: Construction is a very conservative and safety conscious sector and thus getting it to change materials and suppliers is not easy. Friends with benefits: Fly ash, a byproduct of coal burning that’s used in the concrete industry has kept these two industries in a very good and stable relationship. Top Carbon-Neutral Cement Companies 💰 Instead of using limestone, they use carbon-free rocks and their process produces magnesium, which captures CO2. From California, 3 years old and they have raised $55 million from Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures fund. They have already saved 250000 tonnes of CO2 by injecting captured CO2 into concrete. From Canada, 10 years old and they have raised $30 million from Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures fund and others.

Climate Tech Distillery,#03 Green Steel,Decarbonizing an amazing but really polluting material,"We produce massive amounts of steel. Currently around 2 billion tonnes per year. Source: Statista Steel is an amazing material. It has helped us build the world we have today (schools, hospitals, bridges, etc.) and it will also be key in building a net-zero world (wind turbines, solar panels, dams, etc.). It’s also one of the most highly recycled materials in use today (about 30% of total production comes from recycled steel scrap). But producing the virgin steel is really bad for the environment. Currently steel production represents 7% of global greenhouse gas emissions, with over 50% being made in China. Source: Visual Capitalist How is steel made? To make steel you need to separate the oxygen from the iron and add a bit of carbon. Summary of the traditional steelmaking process (left side of diagram): Melt iron ore into iron pellets by using fossil fuels Add a type of coal called coke. Mix it all and get it really hot (1700ºC) in the presence of oxygen. The resulting liquid metal is mixed with recycled “scrap” iron and oxygen. You’re left with steel and lots of CO2 as a byproduct. Making 1 ton of steel this way produces about 1.8 tonnes of CO2. We could just capture the CO2 from the whole process, but the scale and efficiency required are not realistic. Process for making green steel (right side of the diagram): Water is split into hydrogen and oxygen by using electricity from renewable sources. The hydrogen is added to the iron instead of coke. Hydrogen reacts with iron at quite a low temperature (800ºC). The byproduct of this reaction is water, which can be reused in step 1! The resulting “sponge” iron is then mixed with recycled scrap iron. Green hydrogen process emits approx 2.8% CO2 emissions of coke method. Governments need to play a key role in accelerating the transition to green steel with both subsidies and a carbon pricing structure. Cons Lack of green hydrogen and renewable energy: A lot of renewable energy and hydrogen is needed to decarbonize the steel-making industry. The world would need up to three times the currently installed solar and wind energy sources to electrify the existing primary steel production. Source: International Energy Agency Costs: Switching to electricity or hydrogen would require vast amounts of capital spending to erect new plants and retrofit old ones. Plus the existing ones are usually close to coal plants, not green hydrogen plants. Politics: Steel is often associated with GDP growth of many countries and thus it’s of critical political importance, so messing with how it’s made is difficult. Top Green Steel Companies 💰 One of the best capitalised climate tech companies in Europe. Plans to avoid around 1% of global CO2 emissions by 2040. 5 million tonnes produced annually by 2030. Backed by Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures fund. They’re taking a different approach to making green steel which is modular and more cost competitive according to them. Stands for Hydrogen Breakthrough Ironmaking Technology. It’s a joint venture between 3 massive Swedish companies: SSAB (steel making), LKAB (mining) and Vattenfall (energy). Sweeden is green steel’s paradise. ❗Extreme knowledge area❗ If you think this wasn’t enough here are a few more links to dig deeper. Literally everything about green steel.

Climate Tech Distillery,#02 Agrivoltaics,A double harvest for farmers: Food and solar energy,"Read time: 4 minutes In this week’s issue you will learn how to grow food more efficiently while producing more solar energy: Agrivoltaics Source: PV Tech “Converting just 1% of American farmland to agrivoltaics could meet US renewable energy targets and save water and create a sustainable long-term food system” - Oregon State University Top Agrivoltaics News 🗞️ Energy giant Iberdrola is testing an advanced “smart” tracking system to make agrivoltaics more efficient. Another energy giant, Enel, has done a Europe wide experimental project and the results look promising both in terms of agricultural yield and of greater wellbeing of animals and pollinating species. Let’s dive in 🧠 We need to increase solar energy production A LOT if we want to reach net zero. Source: International Energy Agency But installing solar panels requires a significant amount of land. And land that’s great to put solar panels is scarce. We also need it to build towns, preserve ecosystems, and mostly for agriculture. In the US alone, 52% of land is used for agriculture, and in India it’s 60%. That percentage is set to increase since population is growing and getting richer rapidly. One potential solution to address this problem is agrivoltaics. Combining land used for agriculture with solar panels. How does it work? There are several ways to combine farmland with solar panels but the most famous one consists of placing the panels above the plants. Source: MetSolar This is one of those cases where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. It’s a win-win-win situation. Win for the panels: The water evaporation from the plants keeps the air under the panels cool, which increases their efficiency. Solar panels like the sun but they don’t like heat. Win for the plants: Protection from extreme weather conditions (which are becoming more frequent) such as heavy rain, hail, heat, too much sun, etc. Plants like the sun, but only up to a point. If they get too much sun they get stressed and stop photosynthesizing. Source: Lumistrips Win for the farmers: Less water needed for irrigation, since the panels’ shade lowers the evaporation rate. Increased yield of plants since they are not harmed by the weather. An extra source of revenue or a reduction in costs.  2 things can be done with the solar energy generated: Use it in the farm to power machinery, trucks, irrigation systems, etc. Add it to the grid by selling it to an energy provider. Source: Energy Connects Even if the agrivoltaics industry is still young, it’s very promising. It could save a lot of land and water and it’s especially great for dry and hot regions that rely heavily on agriculture. If it’s so awesome, why don’t we use it everywhere? Cons Aesthetics: Farmers are not so open to have this in their farms just like many don’t want to have wind turbines in their land. This is known as the “not in my back yard” effect. Bureaucracy: It changes in every region and the same laws don’t apply when growing food as when producing electricity so it can be very hard to get permits and subsidies. Upfront costs: Setting up the panels high above the plants is 10% to 20% more expensive than having them on the ground. And the structure takes up planting space. Source: Fraunhofer Institute Top Agrivoltaics Projects 💰 I will mention projects instead of companies because any energy company doing solar can get into agrivoltaics. It all started with growing some berries in the Netherlands, the results inspired many of the projects we have now in Europe. This project in Colorado is the biggest in the country and it’s used to teach farmers about the benefits of agrivoltaics. Of the 2.8 GW of agrivoltaics in China this project alone supplies 1 GW. It’s a massive goji berry plantation and Huawei is behind it. Source: PV Magazine ❗Extreme knowledge area❗ If you think this wasn’t enough here are a few more links to dig deeper.

Climate Tech Distillery,#01 Direct Air Capture (DAC),One of the fastest growing carbon removal technologies,"To meet the target limit of 1.5ºC of warming by the end of the century, bringing our emissions all the way down to 0 is not enough. Since the 18th century we have been adding A LOT of CO2 into the atmosphere, and we need to remove it. Source: Nori.com Reducing our emissions is key to keep us from going up in the graph. In order to go back down to that safe level point we need to remove CO2, it doesn’t just go away into space. There are many ways to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. Some solutions are nature-based (not just planting trees) and others are tech-based. There are so many ways to remove carbon from the atmosphere and all of them are so crucial that Elon Musk even launched a to scale them! Source: XPRIZE Foundation But anyways, today I will focus on Direct Air Capture, one of the tech-based solutions to get CO2 out of the air. How does it work? Think of Direct Air Capture machines basically as huge fans that suck large amounts of polluted air directly out of the atmosphere, and just get the CO2 out of it. Here are the steps: The fans suck the air into the system. Some filters get rid of impurities. The air passes through chemical substances, the CO2 gets stuck in them, the rest goes through. The captured CO2 can be released from the chemicals that trapped it simply by applying heat to the mix. You’re left with a high concentration of CO2 on one side and chemical substances that can be reused again on the other. It's kind of how human lungs extract oxygen. Source: Climeworks Actually, there are two main ways DAC works. There’s solid sorbent DAC (the steps and image I just showed) and there’s liquid solvent DAC. You can check out the technical differences at the end, but both work under the same premise: Get CO2 from the ambient air, make it contact some chemicals, apply some heat and electricity to separate the CO2. Once we have the CO2 captured there are 2 main things to do with it: Store it: This is called carbon sequestration. Keeping it safely deep underground to make sure it never goes back out. Sell carbon credits for every tonne of captured and stored CO2 to companies that want to offset their emissions. Use it to make stuff: This is called carbon utilization. If you think about it, most of the things we use have carbon in them! Diamonds, cement, fuels, rubber, Coca Cola, etc. Source: If you are more of a video learner, here's a to understand DAC better (liquid DAC), since I already showed you solid DAC above. Pros of DAC Great measurability: It’s very easy to know exactly how much CO2 was captured, not the case in nature-based solutions. This is key for reporting impact and then selling carbon credits to companies. Adaptable: In theory, a DAC plant can be situated in any location that has low-carbon energy and a CO2 storage resource or CO2 use opportunity. Efficient: It uses very little land and water and it’s quite quick to implement. Cons of DAC Price: Currently really expensive. Between $250 and $1000 per tonne of CO2 captured. It won’t scale fast until prices go under $100 per tonne. Misusage: Some companies are using these offsets as an excuse to pollute more. Besides, old oil wells are ideal for placing the storage of carbon and that builds up pressure that gets oil out more easily (enhanced oil recovery). Huge challenge: We need to capture 60 Mt CO2/year by 2030, we are currently capturing 0.01 Mt CO2/year. Source: International Energy Agency Top Direct Air capture companies 💰 Based in Switzerland. They own 15 out of the 18 currently running DAC plants in the world. They raised a record $650 million in 2022. Uses solid DAC. Based in Canada. Operating since 2009. They are building the world’s largest DAC facility and are building several others worldwide. Uses liquid DAC.

Warming Up to Climate Tech,Challenges and Opportunities of Electric Vehicles,A brief analysis of the electric vehicle space and what it will take to reach mass adoption of EVs.,"In 2019, Herbert Diess, CEO of Volkswagen said that electric vehicles were ""not yet ready for the mass market."" Volkswagen has since announced plans to invest $86 billion in electric vehicles by 2026 . This may sound like hypocrisy, but it's a natural progression for VW alongside the now ever-present climate change concerns. It's necessary for car manufacturers to invest substantially to respond to consumer demand and make their EV models mass-market-ready. Summary Electric cars are currently $12,000 more expensive than combustion cars. You must charge an EV every 200-300 miles. The scarcity of charging infrastructure all across the US is a major challenge for the government to overcome. Being expensive, there are only 20,431 level 3 charging stations (the quickest EV charging stations). It’s six times less than the number of level 2 charging stations - 126,500. more electricity will be drawn from the grid as more people switch to EVs. The demand for electric vehicles worldwide has already increased from 5 to 25 million. The US government is implementing policies to reduce manufacturing costs and offer customer subsidies for EV purchases. Thanks for reading Warming Up to Climate Tech! Subscribe for free to learn more about climate tech every week. Subscribe EVs are the Future of Transportation for Personal & Commercial Road Vehicles Challenges I'll be frank - most people don't want to buy EVs, and for good reasons. There's a higher upfront cost, not many options to choose from, the dreaded 'range anxiety,' and a lack of charging infrastructure. It's a large task to overcome these challenges and convert more gas-guzzling drivers to EV drivers, but the proper policies and infrastructure investments can pave the way for a cleaner, greener future on the road. #1. High Purchase Cost Electric vehicles are more expensive to build than gasoline-powered ones. The primary reason is that they require lithium for their large batteries, which is costly and drives the cost up. Despite the higher upfront cost, electric vehicles promise lower operating costs over their lifetime. But there's a catch - you have to buy it first. With few models on the market sporting a sticker price of less than $30,000, the initial investment can be a significant hurdle for many potential EV buyers. #2. Range Anxiety It's a sunny Saturday morning, and you're setting off on a weekend getaway in your new electric car. The open road beckons, the playlist is set, and the sense of adventure is palpable. But lurking in the back of your mind is - range anxiety. In ideal conditions, your EV promises a range of 200-300 miles on a single charge. It's more than enough for your daily commute, but it's a different story for longer journeys. Those long days on the road, spontaneous detours, and freezing weather all eat into your vehicle's range. And before you know it, you end up taking frequent charging breaks. To charge an EV, there are charging stations built nationwide. There are three primary levels of EV chargers: Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3. Level 2 chargers provide a full charge in as few as 3-4 hours (or as much as 10-12 hours, depending on battery size). A DC fast-charging station can take 30-60 minutes to charge an EV battery to 80%, which sounds fast until you consider how much time that can add to longer journeys—something to consider when traveling cross country. Range anxiety is more than a slight concern for potential EV owners - it's a significant hurdle to overcome and contributes to ~36% of drivers’ reasons for buying a gas car instead of an EV. #3. Limited Selection When we compare the car selection for EVs and gas-powered vehicles, EV models are significantly limited. As of March 3, 2023 there are models available in the US. This is nowhere near the number of models available for a gas-powered vehicle, . Although electric sedans, hatchbacks, and SUVs are becoming more readily available, people looking for a truck or minivan have only a few options. #4. Difficulty Finding a Technician Unlike combustion vehicles, EVs are still relatively new to the market and make up just 2.1% of passenger cars on the road. With so few EVs on the road, finding a specialized mechanic will be challenging. You see, EV engines aren’t the same as combustion engines. The high-voltage systems in these vehicles can pose a danger to an untrained technician, turning a routine repair into a potential hazard. The number of trained EV repair technicians and specialized shops is low. Working on an electric vehicle is not just about changing tires, fixing brakes, or replacing light bulbs. It's a complex task that needs specialized knowledge and training. Most EV owners find themselves relying on their dealer for service. #5. Charging Infrastructure The scarcity of charging stations, particularly in rural and remote areas, is a major challenge the US government has to overcome. It's a game of range anxiety - a constant calculation of miles driven and charge remaining, a race against the battery indicator. In D.C., the issue of EV infrastructure has taken center stage. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, a landmark piece of legislation, has allocated to develop EV charging stations and related infrastructure. This commitment from the federal government to support the transition to electric mobility is a significant step forward. #6. Charging Speeds Charging electric cars can be a problem for drivers as it might force EV owners to adapt their schedules or habits. of public charging stations being Level 2, the amount of time to charge up your EV for the next 3-4 hours of driving can take 4-6 hours or longer. Level 3 chargers are way faster, with some delivering 350 kW power and can fully charge an EV in 15 minutes. The problem is there aren't many of these due to their set-up cost and extreme power consumption. #7. Charger Compatibility There are three different types of DC fast chargers: SAE Combined Charging System (CCS) used by most manufacturers CHAdeMO used by Nissan and Mitsubishi Tesla Supercharger used solely by Tesla vehicles. These compatibility differences can hinder widespread EV adoption, as it differs from the universal access to fuel stations enjoyed by gas-powered vehicles. To overcome this issue, on June 8, 2023, that will allow GM EVs to use Tesla’s Supercharger network for charging. Some note-worthy points from the GM-Tesla collaboration: GM vehicles will be able to use Tesla's Supercharger network starting in early 2024. GM will also begin installing Tesla's charging connector in its EVs starting in 2025. The deal is for North America only, but Tesla has said that it is open to expanding the deal to other regions. #8. Grid Capacity As more people switch to electric vehicles, the electric grid is poised to face a challenge unlike any before. The transition to electric vehicles isn't merely about swapping gas pumps for charging stations. It's about fundamentally reimagining our relationship with energy. As millions plug in their cars, demand on an already strained grid will increase. However, it's important to note that one of the biggest issues with the grid is meeting ""peak demand"" times, when energy use is at its highest. This issue can largely be managed through the optimization of when people ""plug-in"" their vehicles. The possibility of having at-home chargers that automatically adapt to times when electricity is in abundance, like during the night, can help mitigate the strain on the grid. Such smart charging methods could help distribute demand more evenly and prevent potential overloads. The US Department of Energy has predicted a significant surge in electricity consumption by 2050, with a primarily attributed to the rise of electric vehicles. It's a future where every personal car, truck, and SUV is a plug-in EV, a future where the hum of electric motors replaces the roar of internal combustion engines. But what does this mean for our energy infrastructure? The Energy Institute at the University of Texas sought to answer this question, assessing the electrical demand if each state made the switch to electric vehicles. The results were eye-opening. could increase anywhere from 17% in Wyoming to a staggering 55% in Maine. Most states fell within the 20-30% range, a significant increase that could strain existing infrastructure. Opportunities for Original Equipment Manufacturers #1. Increasing Demand for Electric Vehicles (EVs) Driven by mounting environmental concerns, a surge in government incentives, and breakthroughs in battery technology, the global demand for EVs is skyrocketing. In 2022, about 26 million electric vehicles were on the road, up 60% relative to 2021 and more than 5 times the amount as 2018. In this rapidly evolving landscape, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) stand at the precipice of a golden opportunity. It’s not just about adapting to change, but about shaping the future of mobility. For OEMs, it’s a call to broaden their horizons to venture beyond the familiar territories of conventional vehicles. It’s about envisioning product lines that are not just in tune with the times, but one step ahead. They have the opportunity of rolling out a selection of electric vehicles that cater to the diverse needs of today’s eco-conscious, tech-savvy consumer. #2. Government Policies and Incentives Many governments worldwide promote using EVs to reduce carbon emissions and achieve climate goals. They offer various incentives, such as tax credits, subsidies, and grants for EV manufacturers and buyers. This creates a favorable environment for OEMs to invest in the EV sector. Here are some policies the US Department of Transportation has launched to increase EV manufacturing: EV and financing for rural areas The on electric vehicle purchases Advanced technology vehicles manufacturing (ATVM) #3. Advancements in Battery Technology You can see clearly the leaps and bounds we're seeing in battery tech. They're completely changing the game for electric vehicles. They're getting better, more efficient, and, the best part, more affordable. OEMs are using these advancements in battery technology to push the boundaries of what's possible. They're not just tweaking their designs - they're revolutionizing them. They're making electric vehicles that are sleeker, faster, and more energy-efficient. Opportunities for Established Suppliers Charging Infrastructure Development: With the number of EVs increasing rapidly, companies must increase the installation of charging infrastructure with it. One way established companies can do is to provide home and public charging solutions to make everyone's life easy. Electric Heavy-Duty Trucks: Established suppliers like Li Auto, NIO, etc who aren't currently manufacturing heavy-duty should enter the truck manufacturing business as there are just a handful of companies doing so (~20 companies). The heavy-duty truck market surpassed With just 20 players in a marker this big, there’s a lot of opportunity to thrive. Micro-Mobility Solutions: Apart from trucks, established suppliers can have a manufacturing line for micro-mobility EVs like bikes and scooters. Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs): Although currently less common than battery electric vehicles, FCEVs represent another area of opportunity. Suppliers can develop hydrogen storage solutions, fuel cells, and related technologies for these vehicles. Opportunities for Startups Battery Technology: As the demand for EVs increases, there is a growing need for more efficient and cost-effective batteries. Currently, EVs on the road are capable of 77% of the electrical energy from the grid to power at the wheels. There’s a room for improvement here that startups can focus on. EV Manufacturing: When it comes to EVs, customers have car models to choose from. Startups can focus on producing unique EV models, targeting specific market segments, or offering innovative features that set them apart from the competition. Software Solutions: The EV industry requires various software solutions, from battery management systems to navigation and entertainment systems that up and coming startups can launch based on AI and ML. Aftermarket Services: As the number of EVs on the road increases, there will be a growing demand for aftermarket services, including maintenance and repair, battery recycling, and software updates.

Warming Up to Climate Tech,Boox Delivers Sustainable E-commerce for the Next Generation,"A deep dive into the world of reusable e-commerce packaging with Matt Semmelhack, CEO and co-founder of Boox.","Boox, a cutting-edge climate tech startup founded by Matt Semmelhack, is busy revolutionizing the world of sustainable e-commerce packaging. Matt and his team aim to eliminate single-use waste by supplying their reusable packaging to e-commerce brands. In this interview, Matt shares his journey from working at Thistle, a plant-based meal delivery subscription company, to founding Boox as a way to realize his aspirations of combating climate change and leaving the world better off for his children. Matt and I delve into Boox's mission, how they help e-commerce companies strive for sustainability, and the challenges of creating a circular economy in the age of e-commerce. By replacing cardboard shipping boxes with reusable polypropylene boxes that can be returned and then reused, Boox is paving the way for a future where waste is greatly reduced and managed more sustainably. The company has already reached product-market fit and is now looking to evolve further to scale their sustainable e-commerce packaging globally. Jacob Sheldon : In your words, what does Boox do? Matt Semmelhack: Boox supplies reusable boxes and other types of packaging to e-commerce brands. We enable the circular economy for e-commerce brands, starting with reusable packaging. Our mission is to eliminate single-use waste. Although today we primarily supply reusable packaging, what we're building is an ecosystem of circularity and reuse for brands , as well as the end consumers.

Matt: I was working at a company called Thistle, a plant-based meal delivery subscription company. It was my first time working for a mission-driven tech company. I had previously worked in restaurants and opened a few in San Francisco, but I got the bug to work for a company with a bigger mission and growth trajectory. Thistle had a written mission statement related to climate change, which inspired me to focus my career on that issue. I appreciated their approach, which was about helping people eat more plants, making it easier to eat less meat, and not mandating veganism. While working at Thistle, I found that a surprising number of people were canceling their subscriptions because of the trash that came with the meal kits. Customers complained about the waste and questioned the company's commitment to reducing climate change. I proposed that transitioning to reusable packaging could reduce waste, lower costs, and make customers happier, and did some research to demonstrate the long-term financial benefits. The founders loved the idea, but also recognized (rightly so!) the effort required was a whole separate business, not an internal project. So, I left Thistle and started Boox. The other big reason is my kids. My wife and I have three children and they are the driving force behind my passion for Boox. I believe in leaving the world a better place for the next generation, and I want to invest my time in something potentially world-changing. Boox aims to fundamentally change the system of how waste is managed. The dream is that, in 10 years, my oldest daughter will never receive a single-use package in the mail. It's a challenging goal to reach, but that's what we're striving for. Jacob: When you think about your clients, what is the problem you're solving for them? Matt: Just to clarify, when I say ""consumer,” I mean the end user receiving a box, whereas our “client” is a brand that sells and ships products to its customers. Regarding our clients, they're trying to achieve three things: Delight their customers with a better, more eco-friendly experience. Make it easy for them (both the company and end users) to reduce their impact. Make more money or reduce costs. The way we help them achieve the third goal is more complicated than the others. Over the past 20-25 years, consumer preferences have changed. When I was a kid, we didn't choose brands for their sustainability, but now that’s becoming much more important. Only a few brands, like Patagonia, championed sustainability from the beginning. Today, if a brand doesn’t market its sustainability efforts, they’re the outlier and customers are less likely to buy from them–that wasn’t true 20 years ago. What we do for brands is help them be more sustainable and demonstrate that to their customers at the same time. Jacob: It's interesting that what has become an opportunity for these brands has now become a problem. Is that simply due to the increase in e-commerce? Matt: Yes, 100%. The timeline of gross amounts of packaging arriving at your doorstep is directly correlated with the rise of e-commerce. About 25 years ago or so, when people started using the internet, they immediately started buying things online. Digitally native brands without storefronts had to get really good at shipping things quickly. This led to increased packaging and merchandise returns that had to be processed and shipped back. Twenty-five years ago, most people went to stores to buy products. Items picked up off the shelf at a store like Target might have primary packaging but would not need secondary packaging or a shipping box with void fill. Now, every single product has all this packaging because it is shipped in the mail and needs to be protected. The responsibility for dealing with that new and excess waste has shifted from the retail stores to individual consumers and their local waste management infrastructure. Despite the exponential growth of e-commerce over the last 25 years, the infrastructure to deal with its waste hasn't evolved very much. Landfills, garbage trucks, and bins remain essentially the same. The right solution isn't just larger recycling bins; that's just a band-aid, not an actual long-term fix. Jacob: So, speaking of trash and recycling, tell me how Boox's solution is better than recycling. Matt: We've evolved our idea to clarify that we're not anti-recycling. The hierarchy we learned in grade school- Reduce, Reuse, Recycle- still holds. The number one way to lower the amount of garbage is to buy less stuff. However, that's only sometimes possible. We need things, and it's easier to get them online today compared to 20 years ago. We can't just stop buying things online, it’s not a solution. Recycling is effective for certain materials, but if those things are designed to be reused, it would reduce the number of things you need to buy. A circular economy extends the life of an item, leading to fewer items being bought over time. Our Boox boxes and any products we design are intended to be reused first. Second, they're designed to be recycled. It's not just about reusing and not recycling; it's about reusing as much as possible and recycling only when it’s absolutely necessary. There's an ongoing debate about whether recycling a box back into another box is true recycling or ""downcycling"" if it's made into a lower-value item with a shorter lifespan. Ultimately, at Boox, our focus is on responsibly promoting reuse first, then recycling. Jacob: Tell me about how much your boxes are reused before they're recycled. Matt: The reuse rate varies wildly, and we're transparent that there’s a ways to go before we fully solve this problem. There are many types of e-commerce brands, and business models, some of which are more easily adapted to the circular economy than others. We've designed something that works for as many as possible, but it works much better for certain ones than others. Rent the Runway is an excellent example of a business designed for circularity with their sharing economy and reuse across many users. However, this model is unusual and does not represent how most e-commerce works. Our target is the much larger group of brands, where products are shipped from a fulfillment center to the end user without the expectation or incentive of returning. That's why the return rate is important, but the ability for our packaging to be recycled is also crucial since the return rate is less than 100% and we don't expect it to be anytime soon. That's a long-winded way of explaining that the reuse rate of our boxes isn't easily quantified and depends on various factors. Broadly speaking, we see return rates between 5 - 50%. The biggest factors that can increase the return rate are incentives to return and engage, and awareness/education of the consumer. We work with our clients to help increase the return rate over time using these tools. It's a team effort. Jacob: Are there carbon emissions related to the return process? Matt: Certainly, there are carbon emissions related to everything. We measure that through lifecycle analysis, which typically has three parts: production, actual use throughout its life, and end of life or return. For a cardboard box, the lifecycle involves production, shipping to the end user, and then recycling, where the material is broken down and ideally made into another cardboard box. When comparing the lifecycle analysis of our Boox boxes to that of a cardboard box, the production and use stages are very similar and have almost the same amount of emissions. The crucial part is that, while there are emissions associated with recovering our Boox boxes from the consumer, they are significantly less than those of the recycling process. People often assume that transportation is a big part of a product's lifecycle, but in the case of boxes, it's less than 2%. Transportation in this country is quite efficient– it’s not as though a single Boox box is traveling across the country by itself. They’re being moved in full truckloads as efficiently as possible The assumption that once you put something in your recycling bin and it’s immediately turned into another product needs to be revised. In reality, your recycling travels quite a long way before actually being recycled, and then goes through many impact-intensive processes before it can be turned into a new product. The emissions from returning our Boox boxes for reuse are significantly less than those generated when something is recycled. When you get a Boox box back, you can reuse it, skipping the production step for subsequent uses. So, if you can use a Boox box multiple times, it's comparable to using multiple single-use boxes, adhering to the reduce and reuse principles. Jacob: Do you only make cardboard boxes or do you offer other types of packaging? Matt: Actually, our boxes are not made out of cardboard. They're made of polypropylene, which is a plastic material. This might raise eyebrows among environmentalists and climate-conscious people, but not among circular economy advocates. The reason is that while plastic is often vilified, larger plastic items don't typically end up in oceans or forests. When people think about plastic in the environment they picture a plastic bottle or bag floating in the ocean, and the concern is that it will “last forever”. This is a problem with the single-use system, not a materials problem. The fact that a material could last forever is an incredible characteristic for within a circular economy. There's an interesting debate about what should be compostable versus what should be reusable. Some items, like diapers and medical devices, are better off being compostable. Food containers or utensils are another interesting category. Our Boox boxes are made of polypropylene, and we're steadily increasing the amount of post-consumer resin in the boxes. The goal is to reach 100% post-consumer content eventually. The dream is to pull plastic out of the existing waste stream to make reusable Boox boxes, effectively upcycling the material. By doing so, we could actually achieve net positive impact by removing plastic that would otherwise be incinerated or sent to landfills and keeping it in the system forever, inside of reusable products. The ideal scenario is for these boxes to circulate indefinitely, fulfilling their purpose over and over again, locking up the carbon contained in the material. Jacob: With your prototype, it seems that you're already on a path to 100% post-consumer boxes. Do you have a timeline for when you'll be able to reach that goal? Matt: The target is the end of 2024. The limitation isn't technology or price; it's availability. Our manufacturer can make 100% post-consumer boxes for us today but can't make 10 million of them due to material scarcity. It's both exciting and limiting. As we start to ship millions of these boxes made of this material, we can affect the market. Polypropylene is a commodity, and post-consumer polypropylene is not in excess supply due to a lack of demand. As demand increases, the price will rise, and businesses will start collecting and selling post-consumer material, then it will become readily available at scale. The scale of packaging, with 20 billion shipments in the US and 200 billion worldwide, has the potential to move the needle on the entire post-consumer materials market. By making boxes out of post-consumer material instead of cardboard, we could shift the cost of post-consumer material to the point where waste management companies would be incentivized to collect and sell it to our manufacturer, closing the loop and creating a truly circular economy. It's an exciting possibility, but we have to continue to grow to make it a reality. Jacob: This is obviously a huge market. Just how large is it? Matt: These are estimates, but the basic quantities are 20 billion shipments annually in the US, growing at 20% year over year, and 200 billion globally, growing even faster. This only accounts for things shipped in boxes and doesn't include primary packaging, poly bags, or other single-use items. We're working towards becoming the operating system for circularity and reuse in this system, rather than just being a box supplier. We would like to have other manufacturers and partners develop reusable packaging that can be returned using the Boox network. Take this hand cream container, for example. The container itself is recyclable, but not the cap. This item can’t be made to be composted because it would break down during shipping. It needs to be designed for either industrial-scale recycling, or for reuse. Our theory is that there's no way to design packaging for reuse without a system in place for its collection. The packaging market is worth over a trillion dollars globally. The idea is that we'll be able to service all types of reusable packaging once at scale. Jacob: Tell me about your core team, who's on it, and why. Matt: My friend and co-founder, Bob Walton, is of course crucial to the team. He was at Facebook for a long time and is now our CTO. His validation and willingness to work on the idea with me meant a lot. We have a business development team led by Peter Smith, a design team led by Paige Russell, and a finance and operations team led by Lindsey Martin. We also have operations directors in both the US and the UK. Our team is a combination of operations, growth, and tech-focused members. An important aspect of our work is that our boxes are tech-enabled, allowing us to recover, track, and measure our impact and return rates. When a consumer receives a Boox box, a QR code inside leads to a digital experience, which shows how to return the box and serves as a promotional marketing moment for the brand that shipped it. The digital component is vital, and Bob's expertise as a front-end engineer helps make it seamless and delightful for consumers. Jacob: Do you also have a digital experience for your clients? Matt: The digital experiences we create are branded as the client. For example, if you receive a Boox box from Goop, it'll feel like you're interacting with Goop, but they're telling you how to return the box. In their case, they offer a gift as an incentive to return the box. Our position is that Boox powers other brands' sustainability efforts. We're often mentioned in the digital experience, but the focus is on the client's brand. At Boox, we make it as easy as possible for our clients to work with us. We collect and share data with them and we handle all the sustainability analytics and tracking so the client can focus on marketing and selling their products. All they have to do is switch their packaging to Boox. Jacob: What is one thing that your team does really well? Matt: The team is excellent at rolling with the punches and adapting quickly to changes, whether they're macroeconomic factors or micro factors. The company was founded during the pandemic and we've experienced pandemic-related challenges because of that. We've adjusted our branding and focus a few times over the past few years, and the team has been great at reacting, staying positive, and staying focused on the end goal. Jacob: You have a lot of learnings from starting businesses over the past few years. What's one piece of advice you have for other entrepreneurs? Matt: Having started 10+ companies, I've experienced various challenges with different types of businesses. My number one piece of advice is to make sure that whatever you're working on gets you out of bed in the morning, and I don't mean just because you're going to make money. The financial rewards will come with working on something impactful that you care about deeply and work hard on. I've told many entrepreneurs and younger people this: care deeply about what you're doing, and everything else will follow . It's been a challenging three years for sure, but it'll work out if you have a good concept and a great product. Nothing impactful comes easily. Jacob: What's your most persistent issue since starting the company? Matt: Certainly, the lingering effects of the pandemic have been a significant challenge, impacting various aspects such as in-person meetings and team events. For example, we had our first big event with our entire team, flying people in from other countries, and on the first day, one of our employees informed us that he had COVID. Changed the nature of the entire event. It's been a disruption, especially for a young and nimble company like ours. Another pandemic-related issue was the massive shortage of truck drivers and sea freight containers, causing delays in shipping our physical products manufactured overseas. When you're trying to be an innovative, fast-moving company, a 12-week delay due to a container coming from China can throw a wrench in your plans. However, this is a once-in-a-generation problem, so it's a positive thing that our biggest challenge is COVID-related– it's our DNA to deal with challenges, and to work together to get through them Jacob: What about right now? What are you focused on the most? Matt: We've achieved a high level of product-market fit, and now we're in between being a growth-at-all-costs tech venture-backed company and running a profitable business. We're transitioning towards demonstrating that we can be a sustainable company in both senses: reducing environmental impact and supporting our operations with our profits. This transition significantly shifts how we behave, act, target clients, and measure KPIs. It's essential for our future and, if we plan to IPO at some point, we need this foundation of well-run operations and profitability. Jacob: What's your overall goal for the company? Matt: Our goals are to change how people think about waste, how e-commerce packaging works, and ultimately, how e-commerce operates through promoting circularity. A measurable goal is that once my daughter becomes an adult, she'll never receive a cardboard box in the mail. It will be challenging to achieve, but we believe it’s realistic. Additionally, we're focused on inspiring the next generation to think more thoughtfully about reducing, reusing, and recycling. By interacting with millions of products and billions of consumers, while generating hundreds of millions of impressions on social media, we aim to be a good role model for the next generation. Our message is something we believe in, it’s fact-based, and it aligns with our goal of growing the company quickly. Jacob: What's the best way for people to connect with you after they read this? Matt: I can be reached at Matt@boox.eco via email. Our primary communications focus is on our social media, particularly , which is the best way to follow Boox's progress. We're always looking to connect with like-minded people, whether they're interested consumers, brands wanting to switch to reusables and reduce their impact, investors (although we just raised a round), or reporters who love talking about sustainability.

Warming Up to Climate Tech,Reducing Industrial Emissions: Steel and Cement,Innovations and startups creating a greener future in steel and cement,"Summary Steel and cement alone contribute to 15% of global emissions. 7% comes from steel production and production. For $278 billion, steel could be made with zero carbon emissions by 2050 with green hydrogen playing a significant role in this process. Startups like Boston Metal, Blastr, and Green Steel are trying to reduce CO 2 emissions in the steel manufacturing process by replacing coke - a fuel used in the steel manufacturing process that’s created by heating coal in the absence of air and fossil fuels with renewable energy sources and green hydrogen. The best way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cement production is by replacing concrete with a polymer or other material so it isn’t produced at all. Startups like CarbonCure, Geoprime Betolar, Solidia are working to replace cement or concrete with lower CO 2 emitting substances. Thanks for reading Warming Up to Climate Tech! Subscribe for free to receive articles on climate tech every week. Subscribe Carbon Emissions from Steel Direct CO 2 emissions from crude steel production are 1.4 tons per ton of steel, making it one of the largest carbon emitters globally, contributing . The country that produces the most steel is China (~1.875 billion per year) which leads to carbon emissions of 3.375 billion tons. The production-to-emissions ratio in China is higher because the majority of the steel they produce comes from the blast furnace method . With this method, iron ore is heated to 1500 degrees Celsius, and oxygen is blasted on liquid iron to remove impurities. Heating iron ore to such a high temperature is, of course, incredibly energy intensive. More recently, manufacturers have discovered a secondary method, one that emits less CO 2 . It’s called the electric arc furnace method (EAF), where the primary raw material in this process is steel scrap that’s heated in the electric arc furnace at 3500 degrees Celsius. Where emissions from the blast furnace process are 1.987 tonnes of CO 2 per ton of steel, the electric arc furnace process emits just 0.357 tonnes of CO 2 per ton, an 82% reduction in emissions. There are two reasons why the electric arc furnace method for steel production emits less CO 2 as compared to the blast furnace method: Raw Material Used: Blast furnaces primarily use iron ore as a raw material, which must undergo a reduction process involving coke (made from coal) to extract the iron. This process emits a significant amount of carbon dioxide. Whereas EAFs use a substantial proportion of recycled steel (scrap) as a raw material, which doesn't require a reduction process and reduces the associated CO 2 emissions. Energy Source: Blast furnaces require significant amounts of carbon-intensive energy sources such as coke and coal, which release large amounts of CO 2 when burned. Electric arc furnaces use electricity, which can come from renewable sources that reduce carbon emissions significantly. Carbon Emissions from Cement , every metric ton of cement produced emits 0.776 tons of carbon dioxide. Due to the increasing demand for cement year over year, it’s becoming more difficult to reduce CO 2 emissions. Cement acts as the binder between aggregates (fine and coarse rocks) in the formation of concrete and is primarily produced via a dry process where several elements - limestone, shells, and chalk or marl are combined with shale, clay, slate, blast furnace slag, silica sand, and iron ore by heating. These ingredients are heated at high temperatures to form clinker and then cement. During the clinker production stage in the kiln, limestone (calcium carbonate) is heated and breaks down to form lime (calcium oxide), releasing CO 2 in the process. This chemical reaction is referred to as calcination. Roughly 60% of emissions from cement production are due to this process. CaCO 3 → CaO + CO 2 Reducing Carbon Emissions from Steel Production #1. Green Hydrogen Usage in Furnaces and Heating By 2050, green hydrogen has the potential to become the cheapest fuel for steel products and capture 31% of the market share. found that, with additional investments of $278 billion, steel could be made with zero carbon emissions by 2050, and will play a significant role in this process. Right now, a whopping 70% of steel is produced using coal-fired blast furnaces: Direct reduced iron and electric arc furnace methods are the methods that use green hydrogen to manufacture steel, so the world needs many more of those types of plants. China, being the dominant player in the steel industry (57% of the world’s total steel production), will set the direction for the industry as a whole. Their current focus is on increasing recycling and energy efficiency before adopting new technologies like green hydrogen and carbon capture to strive toward net zero. #2. Blast Furnace/Blast Oxygen Furnace Efficiency Programs BF/BOF efficiency programs can improve efficiency and decrease production losses by: Optimizing the BF burden mix through maximizing the iron content in raw materials, decreasing the usage of coal as a reductant. Replacing coke by introducing an alternative fuel into the furnace, such as natural gas, biomass, or hydrogen. Using Pulverized Coal Injection technique to replace coke. It’s a technique that involves grinding coal into a fine powder and then injecting it into the blast furnace. Using coke oven gas in the BF as an energy source. #3. Biomass Reductants Replacing fossil fuels with biomass reductants like heated and dried sugar, energy cane, or pyrolyzed eucalyptus can help reduce carbon emissions during steel production significantly. But the major challenge with using reductants is their availability. For example, the biomass reductants mentioned above are available in abundance in South America and Russia, but it’s tough to decarbonize the steel industry just by using reductants in Europe as it doesn't have reductants in abundance. #4. Carbon Capture and Storage emissions from large point sources like power plants and industrial facilities and transporting and storing the gas in underground geological formations. #5. Increase Share of Scrap-Based EAFs By increasing steel production by EAFs, producers can produce more environmentally friendly steel. But the main challenge to scale the EAF process is the availability of high-quality steel scrap and the need for renewable electricity in abundance. Overcoming these challenges is critical because recycling via EAF is crucial in decarbonizing the steel industry. Startups Decarbonizing Steel Production #1. Boston Metal is trying to electrify the entire steel industry with direct, efficient, and modular solutions and decarbonizing the sector as soon as possible. The company has developed an electrical steel production process that eliminates the use of coal and instead uses direct electric current to separate chemical compounds into their constituent parts. The raw material used in their method of steel production is ferrous oxide (iron ore - Fe 2 O 3 ) that reacts with an electron to split into iron and oxygen: Fe 2 O 3 + e - → Fe + O 2 The benefit of this process is that it can also turn low-quality iron ore into high-quality molten iron, saving millions of dollars that manufacturers spend for buying high-quality iron. #2. Blastr is taking a huge step towards zero carbon emissions in the steel industry by replacing coal and coke with hydrogen in the steel production process. Their mission is to challenge the status quo in the steel industry by developing integrated, decarbonized, and scalable value chains for ultra-low CO₂ steel production. They use a direct-reduction pellet plant to convert high-grade iron ore into steel. #3. H2 Green Steel Situated in Boden, North Sweden, can produce steel with 95% less carbon emissions than the traditional method. Just like the companies mentioned above, H2 Green Steel replaces coal with hydrogen; water and heat are the only primary emissions. They aim to produce 5 million tons of steel annually by 2030 and avoid 0.3 billion tons of CO 2 emissions, about 1% of total annual emissions. Reducing Carbon Emissions During Cement Production #1. Finding Clinker Alternatives CO 2 emissions in cement manufacturing are directly proportional to the amount of clinker used. The more clinker produced during the process, the more carbon is emitted. So the first significant step to reduce emissions is to replace clinker with something that emits comparatively less or the best possible scenario - no carbon. Many cement producers have started using less polluting substitutes like natural and calcined pozzolans. Pozzolans are naturally occurring siliceous and aluminous materials that possess no cementitious value. But when finely divided in the presence of water, it reacts with calcium hydroxide at normal temperature. Other alternatives include industrial byproducts such as fly ash. #2. Alternative Fuel A shift to less carbon-intensive alternative fuels, such as waste and biomass, for heating kilns (a furnace used to produce cement) could decrease direct CO 2 emissions from global cement production by 9% by 2050. However, the feasibility of this shift depends on the availability of alternative fuels and the development of local supply chains. #3. Carbon Cured Concrete This technology injects CO 2 captured during cement production and “locks in” CO 2 in the end product. The technique also helps accelerate the curing process. Low-carbon cement technologies can sequester up to 5% of CO 2 , potentially up to 30% in the future. per year are projected to be stored via carbon-cured concrete by 2050. Startups Decarbonizing Cement Production #1. CarbonCure creates carbon removal technologies to help the concrete industry build more efficient businesses and produce cleaner concrete. Their technology introduces recycled CO 2 into fresh concrete and reduces the carbon footprint without compromising quality. Once injected into the concrete, this CO 2 undergoes a chemical reaction and transforms into a mineral, improving the compressive strength of the concrete. #2. Geoprime Betolar Geoprime is a sustainable and cement-free infrastructure solution for a range of concrete product applications. This concrete substitute emits 80% lower CO 2 and has the same toughness as concrete. Geoprime is made from geopolymer - an inorganic polymer that’s used to create new materials. aims to use it in infrastructure projects, including paving blocks, poles, and construction blocks. R&D on Geoprime is still in the process of discovering more ways to use it as a replacement for concrete. #3. Solidia is a cement and concrete technology company offering green solutions that make using CO 2 to create superior and sustainable building materials easy and profitable. Solidia said their tech could eliminate a minimum of 1.5 gigatons of CO 2 annually. The company provides two core technologies: Sustainable Cement Manufacturing Technology: Can be produced in kilns but with less energy and reduces carbon emissions by 30-40%. Sustainable Concrete Curing Technology: Curing concrete with CO 2 instead of water consumes 240 kgs of CO 2 permanently and saves ~3 trillion liters of water annually. Wrapping Up Industrial emissions, specifically steel and cement production, are major contributors to global CO 2 emissions. To reduce emissions in the steel industry, companies should increase the use of green hydrogen as an alternative fuel for coke and coal as much as possible. But to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in cement production, the best way is to replace concrete with new innovative materials to avoid cement production altogether.

Jacob: What motivated you to start Bend? Ted: Well, about a year ago, we embarked on the journey of founding Bend with a strong desire to make a meaningful contribution toward addressing the urgent issue of climate change. It's undeniably one of the defining challenges of our generation. However, what propelled us was the recognition of a specific opportunity. Prior to Bend, I co-founded a company called Abacus, which is an expense management platform. In 2018, we successfully sold Abacus to a larger company named Inverse, a prominent player in spend management with substantial annual revenue. During our time at Abacus, we discovered something intriguing through customer conversations. We were helping these businesses manage their travel expenses, hosting costs, and marketing spend. It became apparent that for many of them, these categories constituted the largest sources of emissions. Some of our customers were already contemplating how they could engage with the climate impact of their operations. They faced mounting pressure from customers, investors, and employees to address this critical issue. It became evident that this was a natural area where we could integrate climate considerations. With this realization, Bend was born. Our primary objective was to harness the immense value of an organization's spending data—the wealth of information generated through their day-to-day operations—and overlay climate insights onto that data. For instance, we automated calculating CO2 emissions from flights and assisted companies in reevaluating their travel policies. We also focused on optimizing emissions related to website hosting, enabling companies to make informed decisions about their AWS regions and other factors. It's important to note that what we're doing is not groundbreaking. Many companies already engage in carbon accounting, utilizing data to generate reports and context. However, the current state of climate data is such that only the largest corporations can justify the resources required for this endeavor due to its highly manual nature. Our goal at Bend is to unlock the potential of the remaining 99% of companies that have yet to engage meaningfully with their climate impact. Achieving this necessitates automating the process, and we understand that most teams need dedicated sustainability officers or individuals solely focused on these matters. Therefore, our focus lies in automating climate data analysis using existing transactional data—an abundant source of valuable insights. Jacob: What specific problem does Bend solve? Ted: The problem we're solving is the costly and time-consuming process of carbon accounting. Many companies understand the importance of measuring their emissions and addressing climate impact, and existing methods can be manual and often require expensive consultants or carbon accounting tools. These traditional approaches involve uploading CSV files and extensive data manipulation, resulting in a slow and inefficient process. The challenge is that this delayed information hinders effective decision-making and integration of climate considerations into business operations. Bend tackles this problem by automating carbon accounting and integrating it into the financial tools that companies already use. We streamline the measurement of emissions and provide real-time insights, enabling businesses to understand their impact and identify reduction opportunities more efficiently. By embedding climate data into their existing financial processes, we make it accessible, cost-effective, and actionable for organizations of all sizes. Jacob : Is Bend a full replacement for the current corporate credit cards companies use today? Do all expenses have to come through the Bend card? Ted : We would love for companies to utilize our cards for as many expenses as possible. However, we understand that businesses have established financial processes and it may only be feasible to partially replace their existing corporate cards in the near term. Companies have integrated their card information across various platforms and services online, making it challenging to transition abruptly. Typically, when companies start using Bend, they route specific categories of expenses through our cards. For example, it could be business travel, Google Workspace subscriptions, or AdWords campaigns. This approach allows them to test the waters and get familiar with Bend. It's not necessary to migrate everything on day one. However, if companies wish to make claims about being net zero or track total company emissions, we need visibility into their overall spending. This can be achieved by consolidating relevant expenses onto the Bend card. Nevertheless, we provide connectors for platforms like QuickBooks and other financial institutions, so larger and more complex companies can utilize Bend alongside their existing accounts. It all works seamlessly together. There's no issue with using Bend in conjunction with QuickBooks or other bank accounts; it's a flexible and adaptable solution. Jacob: How do you calculate their emissions? Ted : It's a fairly common process used by various organizations, such as Google, Microsoft, and Salesforce. It's not exactly light reading, but if you delve into corporate sustainability reports, you'll find that the methodology is quite similar. Specifically, when it comes to scope three goods and services emissions, which can get a little wonky, it's something we specialize in. The approach we and other organizations employ involves linking business activities with emissions factors. Let me give you an example. Suppose you visit your local Starbucks and purchase a coffee. Bend has an emissions factor specifically designed for Starbucks. How do we come up with this factor? We gather data from Starbucks' most recent sustainability report, which includes all their greenhouse gas emissions and their revenue for that period. The emissions factor reflects the carbon intensity of $1 spent at Starbucks. Using this factor, we can estimate the CO2 emissions associated with a specific amount spent, like $7 at Starbucks, or even less. Jacob: Are you correlating the emissions data of Starbucks with their revenue on a dollar-for-dollar basis? In other words, determining the emissions per dollar of revenue and applying the same correlation to the amount they spend? Ted: Yes, that's correct. Our process involves generating emissions factors for hundreds of companies. These factors can be at the corporate level or even at the business unit level. For example, we differentiate between purchasing an Apple laptop and buying Apple ads because they have distinct carbon footprints. To achieve this, we utilize detailed sustainability data provided by Apple and align it with their financial reporting, including revenue breakdown by business unit. This methodology is applied when we have robust and specific data from the merchant. However, in cases where a local coffee shop doesn't disclose sustainability data, we rely on category emissions factors. Every action is associated with a merchant category code, and we have expended significant effort to develop a comprehensive set of factors for these codes. Additionally, we are increasingly obtaining individual-level or line-item-level emissions estimates, providing us greater precision. For instance, through our integration with Amazon Business, we capture the purchase price and the specific product details, thanks to the super-detailed emissions factors we have for each item and category in Amazon's catalog, linked to the unique UN SPSC codes. We acquire specific route data for flights, exact gallons of gas for purchases at gas stations, and so on. In each case, we provide a confidence score, indicating the reliability of the data. For highly granular and accurate data, such as those mentioned, we have high confidence scores, while our confidence level may be lower for general coffee shop purchases. It's important to note that while the data could be better, our primary focus is two-fold: enabling automation and identifying emission reduction opportunities. Instead of scrutinizing every transaction's CO2 calculation, we aim to highlight key areas where companies can significantly impact, such as reevaluating travel policies or website hosting practices. We present this information to companies as both nerdy carbon accounting and as actionable insights for emission reduction. Jacob: I noticed you also offer treasury management. Could you tell me about that? Ted: Absolutely. At the core of everything is a cash account. As a business, you need a secure place to store your money. When you join Bend, you'll enjoy a highly competitive interest rate of 4% APY, which is quite remarkable. If you compare it to other options available in the market, you'll see that it stands out as a leading rate. Along with that, we provide all the essential features you would expect from a business account. You can easily send ACH transfers and wires and have an account and routing number for seamless transactions. Our focus is to ensure that companies don't have to compromise on basic account functionality while benefiting from our climate-friendly approach. Our top priority is building a secure, FDIC-insured, high-yield account with robust money management and spend management controls. The climate-related aspects are undoubtedly exciting, but we firmly believe that establishing a strong foundation is paramount. Jacob: Who is your target market for the Bend card and Treasury account? Ted: At a high level, our target market encompasses any organization or business that aims to be more climate-friendly and seeks recognition for their positive climate actions. That's the broad picture. To delve into specifics, our early customers come from diverse range of sectors. We have startups in the climate tech industry, individuals fixing up sailboats and documenting their journey on YouTube, as well as law firms, which we have been actively engaging with. Additionally, we are collaborating with certain nonprofits. We are currently in the experimental phase to determine the specific customer profiles we can serve effectively. Our target market generally consists of companies that desire to engage meaningfully with climate issues but may lack the resources or capacity to dedicate extensive time and effort to it. They want to integrate climate considerations into their core operations seamlessly. Jacob: Can you share a specific success story you've had so far? Ted: Certainly, I can provide a couple of examples. Let's start with one of our great customers, Fathom. They operate in a similar space as Otter, offering video note-taking services. If you visit their website, you'll notice a prominent mention that they track their emissions with Bend. With the founder's permission, I can share their story. During a conversation with the founder, he explained that they decided to use Bend due to the escalating costs associated with hosting their services last year. They invested significant time and effort in optimizing their hosting arrangements, driven primarily by cost considerations. However, it's worth noting that they also achieved substantial climate benefits alongside cost reduction. This pattern is quite common. In uncertain economic climates, there is a misconception that climate action is purely an added cost. In reality, many cost optimization measures also contribute to emissions reductions. For instance, cutting unnecessary travel, reevaluating event-related expenses, optimizing hosting costs, or consolidating software licenses have positive climate impacts. Companies choose Bend because it provides a safe way to simultaneously achieve cost reductions and receive recognition for their climate-friendly efforts. It allows them to amplify their achievements and gain credit for cost reduction and emissions reduction endeavors, all in one concerted effort. Jacob: I noticed on Fathom's website they have a ""Net Zero Certified"" badge that links to a Bend page showcasing their recent emissions and offsets, even as recent as last month. Could you explain the process behind certifying companies and how they utilize this feature beyond what I'm observing? Ted: Absolutely. When companies take such actions, we also want to assist them in promoting their efforts. Let me provide you with some examples of early customers who have utilized Bend in this manner. Rushton is a fascinating company that leverages Bend in a similar way. Another example is Delighted, a net promoter score survey tool. Likewise, if you visit Harmonic's website, specifically Harmonic AI, you'll find a link in the footer that directs you to their Bend profile. Companies can share their data, generate reports, and display them. They can choose to export the report as a PDF or publish their profile. We collaborate with them to ensure the accuracy of the information presented. Notably, once the setup is complete, the process becomes entirely automated. As you mentioned, the information displayed is up-to-date, reflecting the most recent month's data. It's worth mentioning that even large Fortune 500 companies with dedicated sustainability teams typically release reports only once a year. However, with Bend's automation, updates occur seamlessly on a rolling basis without requiring any additional actions. Jacob: Who are the individuals involved, and what motivates them? Ted: As an early-stage company, our core team consists of myself, Thomas, who is my co-founder, and an exceptional climate scientist named Marion, based in the UK. Thomas and I have previously worked together at our former company, Abacus, where he excelled as one of our top engineers. Marion brings a unique skill set to the team with dual degrees in economics and Earth Sciences, making her the perfect combination of finance and climate expertise. She is deeply dedicated to the methodology aspect of our work. Currently, that forms the heart of our team. Additionally, we have a small group of individuals who assist us in various capacities. It's important to note that we are still in the early stages of our journey. We went through Y Combinator last summer, secured funding of $2.5 million in the fall, and just recently launched our new product about two weeks ago. At this stage, we are actively seeking organizations and companies to try out our platform, and we are eagerly looking forward to what lies ahead. Jacob: I understand how you assist companies in quantifying their climate impact and achieving net zero, but how do you measure and quantify your positive climate impact? Ted: I have yet to calculate the exact numbers, but I want to be cautious because we can't solely take credit for our customers' positive climate actions. Our customers deserve recognition for their efforts. However, it's quite interesting for us to consolidate the data and assess the overall emissions reduction achieved by our customers. We are currently tracking emissions associated with tens of millions of dollars in spending. Ultimately, our goal is to contribute to significant emissions reductions, reaching gigatons of emissions. The more emissions we can help companies manage and reduce, the greater our impact. Jacob : What is one particular strength that you and your team possess? Ted: Our team excels in the product. We thrive when we release new features, engage customers, and iterate rapidly. If we’re self-critical, we might say that marketing is an area where we could be more naturally skilled. Nevertheless, we truly excel at building products. Jacob: What's your current marketing strategy? Ted: We're taking advantage of opportunities like this conversation with you at this stage. Being at this early stage allows us to do things that may need to be more scalable in the long run. In the future, we'll need a more coordinated approach, including product marketing, generating demand, and direct sales or sales development. For now, we can reach out to people via email, have conversations, understand their business objectives, and explore how we can assist them. That's how we're currently approaching marketing, and as we grow, we'll adapt and scale accordingly. Jacob: What is your 60-second pitch to a customer? Ted: Use Bend to become climate-friendly, earn a high yield, and enjoy great Spend Management features. Many companies believe there's a trade-off between climate-consciousness and sacrificing other business aspects, and we want to dispel that myth. With Bend, you can take actions that reduce costs and have a positive climate impact. It doesn't require extensive manual effort, hiring consultants, or compromising margins. You can run an efficient, high-margin business while being mindful of the environment. We provide a solution that combines financial benefits with climate consciousness, making it easier for businesses to contribute to a greener future. Jacob: What's one piece of advice you have for other entrepreneurs? Ted: If I were to give one piece of advice, and it may sound a bit self-serving, it's important to recognize that climate issues will impact every industry. Climate ultimately revolves around resource allocation. My advice, especially for young entrepreneurs and individuals entering the workforce, is to consider how you can engage with climate-related issues. It doesn't necessarily mean everyone needs to join a climate-focused organization. Often, you can have just as much or more influence by advocating for change within your current roles. That's the key message. I understand the overwhelming nature of the problem, and it can be hard to see how you can make a meaningful impact. However, I want people to believe they have more power than they realize, particularly within their areas of expertise. For example, if you're a CTO or an engineer, you can optimize your code and transition to a data center powered by renewable energy. If you're a project manager, consider travel policies and promoting electric vehicle use. If you're in finance or procurement, incorporate sustainability considerations into your procurement processes. Even as a marketing manager, you can make conscious choices in events and partnerships. Every job has a surprising amount of leverage that aligns with overall business objectives and doesn't require compromising profitability. No job lacks a pragmatic approach to contribute to the cause. Even managing a 401(k), you can choose climate-aligned funds. Engaging with climate issues is not only the right thing to do but also enhances career prospects. This field will only grow in importance, and being recognized as someone engaged in this area can lead to promotions and other opportunities. That's my recommendation. Jacob: What has been the most persistent issue since starting Bend? Ted: It may sound somewhat pessimistic, but the most challenging aspect has been achieving product-market fit and navigating the climate space. The clean energy transition is a monumental task, with various factors such as the decreasing cost of solar, electric vehicles (EVs), and battery storage. There are positive developments, but it's still early, particularly in the United States. The landscape is rapidly evolving, although other regions like Europe have more established policies that drive climate engagement. In the US, companies often engage with climate voluntarily rather than due to external pressure. Most of our customers are driven by a mission and care deeply about the cause, and I truly appreciate them for it. However, this remains our biggest challenge: How can we navigate the market's relatively early stage, push for faster progress, and simultaneously make activation more accessible? We strive to ride the wave as more companies express their interest in climate engagement while working towards reducing the barriers to entry. Jacob: The most challenging companies to onboard are often the biggest emitters and require significant investment to achieve net-zero status. It poses a significant barrier, but it's also where substantial carbon emission reductions can be made. How do you approach this? Ted: There's an interesting dynamic at play here. On the one hand, certain sectors of the economy are inherently more carbon intensive, making it challenging to steer them toward the right path. It's undoubtedly the most difficult aspect. On the other hand, there are companies in sectors such as law, consulting, and tech that have lower carbon intensity. Some might argue that their impact could be more significant. However, it is all the more reason to help these low-hanging fruit cases credibly transition to net zero. If we don't start there, we will never be able to tackle the more challenging cases. Every company can contribute, and it's important to avoid the tendency of deflecting responsibility by pointing to others who may have even worse emissions. We greatly admire companies that step up and engage, even if they begin from a relatively lower carbon intensity standpoint. A good example is the multitude of remote-first companies we work with—they don't have emissions from managing extensive office spaces and real estate. Acknowledging and crediting such efforts while considering all these variables is crucial. It's commendable when companies fully embrace their impact and actively work towards sustainability. Jacob: What is the overarching goal for Bend? Ted: Our ultimate goal is to ensure that every business receipt and purchase decision includes the financial aspect and the associated CO2 emissions. We aim to empower businesses to make informed purchase decisions by providing upfront visibility into the environmental impact. Tracking and monitoring these impacts throughout the process is vital to achieving our goal. Ultimately, we strive to help an increasing number of companies understand their climate footprint.

Warming Up to Climate Tech,Path to 100% Green Hydrogen,Unraveling the challenges and potential of Green Hydrogen as a factor in reaching net-zero emissions.,"As we plan to achieve net-zero emissions in the coming decades, green hydrogen seems to be a promising fuel that can be used as a fossil fuel alternative. But there are many barriers the world needs to overcome to produce and use green hydrogen. Actionable Insights People have been trying to use hydrogen as fuel since the 1800s, but it was never seen as the primary energy source due to its production cost. Research by McKinsey estimates that the hydrogen market will generate profits exceeding 2.5 trillion USD by 2050 due to the prediction of a rise in hydrogen demand from 10 to 78 EJ. Electrolysis is the process used to create clean hydrogen. The process separates water into hydrogen and oxygen but is expensive. Hydrogen has color ratings - Green, gray, and black. Production of green hydrogen emits no greenhouse gases while producing black hydrogen emits the most greenhouse gases. The world is focused on using hydrogen in the transportation and power sector to replace fossil fuels and decarbonize Earth. Cost remains one of the key challenges to overcome to scale green hydrogen production. Thanks for reading Warming Up to Climate Tech! Subscribe for free to learn more about climate tech every week. Subscribe Hydrogen was first discovered in 1766. Its first use case as fuel was to fly hot air balloons in 1783. Hydrogen-fuel-based cars were introduced later in the 19th century, but they were of no use due to the availability of cheaper fuel sources. The concept of electrolysis, a key process in producing green hydrogen, has existed since the 1800s. British scientist Michael Faraday first introduced the laws of electrolysis in the 1830s. However, due to the dominance of fossil fuels, hydrogen wasn't prioritized as an energy carrier during this period. The oil crises in the 1970s led to an increased interest in alternative energy sources. Hydrogen began to be looked at more seriously as a clean energy carrier. In the 1990s, the 'Hydrogen Economy' concept started to gain traction, proposing hydrogen as a potential solution for reducing carbon emissions. In the 21st century, scientists continued the research and development of hydrogen technologies. However, the production of green hydrogen was still limited due to high costs and a lack of adequate renewable energy sources. Technological advancements and an increased focus on clean energy sources have made producing green hydrogen more feasible. The cost of renewable energy has now significantly decreased, making the production of green hydrogen more economically viable. In the 2020s, green hydrogen is considered a key component in achieving global decarbonization goals. Major industries such as transport, manufacturing, and power are looking towards green hydrogen as a potential solution to reduce their carbon emissions. Despite the challenges such as high production costs, storage and transport issues, the potential of green hydrogen is widely recognized. Research by McKinsey forecasts that the hydrogen market will create more than $2.5 trillion in profits and millions of jobs by 2050. That’s because the demand for hydrogen will rise significantly. Another research report by IHS Markit reveals that the investment in green hydrogen will exceed . Development of Green Hydrogen Green hydrogen is produced through a process known as electrolysis, specifically water electrolysis. This process involves separating water into two main elements: hydrogen and oxygen. This method of obtaining green hydrogen is expected to save emitted annually when this gas is produced via fossil fuels. Here’s an that explains the process of green hydrogen production accurately: The only limitation of conducting this process is that it's expensive. A Modern Way to Produce Hydrogen with Methane Pyrolysis In Methane pyrolysis, thermal energy is applied to CH 2 to break the chemical bond between carbon and hydrogen to generate hydrogen and a solid carbon bi-product with no CO 2 emission. Here are the benefits of methane pyrolysis over other methods: Methane pyrolysis is less polluting than other large-scale methods and can produce hydrogen with zero carbon emissions. It is less energy intensive as compared to conventional methods of hydrogen production. It’s a great use of methane that will otherwise pollute the atmosphere. The process is scalable with a future grid powered by intermittent renewable energy sources. The by-product of the process, carbon black, is a valuable product with a market size of 13.22 billion USD. Hydrogen Color Ratings Hydrogen is given a color grading based on its purity and production method. Research conducted at the end of 2021 by the (IREA) found that around 47% of hydrogen production comes from natural gas, 27% from coal, 22% from oil, and only 4% from electrolysis. This means only 4% of the total hydrogen produced was green. 47% of hydrogen was gray, 27% was black, and 22% was a mix of gray, black, and other color grades, except for green. Let’s get to know about these color grades in detail. 🟢 Green Hydrogen It's the hydrogen produced through the electrolysis of water, where the electricity used in the process comes from renewable sources such as solar or wind power. This process does not emit CO2, hence the term ""green."" Green hydrogen is the most environmentally friendly method of producing hydrogen, but it's also currently the most expensive due to the high costs of renewable energy and electrolysis equipment. ⚪ Gray Hydrogen Gray hydrogen is produced through a process called , where natural gas (methane) is combined with high-temperature steam in the presence of a catalyst to produce hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and a small amount of carbon dioxide. The CO 2 is often released into the atmosphere, making this a carbon-intensive process. Gray hydrogen is currently the most common type of hydrogen produced due to its lower costs than green hydrogen. ⚫ Black Hydrogen Black hydrogen is produced by gasifying coal. This process involves heating coal to a high temperature to produce a mix of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, resulting in significant carbon emissions. ""Black"" refers to the pollution and high CO2 emissions associated with this process. This method is less common in regions with strong environmental regulations, but it's still used in some parts of the world where coal is abundant and cheap. Opportunities for Clean Hydrogen to Push For Net-Zero The demand for green hydrogen will only grow in the coming decade, so it's important to prioritize green hydrogen production where high-efficiency and low-cost options like electrification fail to work. Over time, the growth of clean hydrogen supply across industrial sectors may also lead to the deployment of large-scale distribution infrastructure that connects regions of low-cost supply with large-scale demand. Importance of Green Hydrogen DOE Launched H2@Scaler in 2016 was launched in 2016 by the DOE and its national labs for deep decarbonization. This strategy aims to produce clean hydrogen from diverse domestic resources and use it across sectors. H2@Scale has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly. For example, the DOE estimates that by 2050, H2@Scale could reduce US greenhouse gas emissions by up to 50%. The concept is still in its early stages of development, but it can potentially be a major contributor to the US effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. Here are some of the key benefits of H2@Scale: Reduces Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from various sectors, including electricity generation, transportation, and industry. Creates Jobs: The development of H2@Scale could create millions of new jobs in the clean energy sector. Boosts Economic Growth: The H2@Scale economy could boost economic growth by trillions of dollars over the next few decades. Makes the US More Energy Secure: Help make the US more energy secure by reducing the country's reliance on imported fossil fuels. Green Hydrogen’s Use in Transport Industry According to a survey in 2021, the transportation industry in the US is responsible for 28% of greenhouse gas emissions. Governments and companies have tried replacing fossil fuels with electric batteries, but hydrogen fuel cells offer significant opportunities for applications requiring long driving ranges, fast fueling, and large or heavy payloads. The DOE works with multiple companies and laboratories on the to reduce emissions from trucks and buses via safe and cost-effective techniques. Batteries and fuel cells are the two major focus areas of 21 CTP. The DOE also launched the (M2FCT) in 2020 to enable the fuel cell durability, cost, and performance required for the long-haul heavy-duty truck market. Apart from roadways, the government also plans to use hydrogen to reduce carbon emissions in the aviation industry. Before Covid-19, the aviation industry was responsible for ~11% of carbon emissions in the US. The primary source to decarbonize the aviation sector is launching Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs), like bio-fuels and power-to-liquid fuels that can replace conventional jet fuels. Keeping this in mind, in 2021, the DOE, DOT, and USAD came together and launched a government-wide Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that attempts to reduce cost, enhance sustainability, and increase SAF's production and use. Here’s what the aim behind the MOU is: Reduce carbon emissions in the aviation industry by 50% Meeting the goal of supplying sufficient SAF to meet 100% of aviation fuel demand by 2050 Using Green Hydrogen in Power Sector Places like hospitals and data centers need electricity 24/7, and these places use diesel as their backup or secondary electricity source. Green hydrogen could replace diesel as a secondary power source. Although backup power usage is low, replacing fossil fuels with green hydrogen is a step in the right direction. Another sector where hydrogen can be of great use is energy storage. The grid energy storage currently relies on pumped hydropower deployments capable of discharging power for 12 hours or less. Lithium-ion batteries are the faster-growing alternatives of such hydropower deployments, but they can store energy for short periods of time (4 hours or less). As the , longer-duration energy storage technologies that can discharge for multiple days will be needed, and clean hydrogen is the answer. Facilities can use electrolyzers to produce hydrogen using excess power on the grid, store it in bulk, and use it when the demand for power rises. Use of Green Hydrogen to Decarbonize Steel Manufacturing Industry Energy-related emissions from the manufacturing of iron and steel account for 6.1% of global emissions. Steel is produced mainly by two methods worldwide - Electric arc furnace (EAF) or Blast furnace basic oxygen furnace (BF - BOF). The former uses scrap, and the latter uses coke and iron ore along with scrap to manufacture iron. The best way to decarbonize is through the replacement of fossil fuels used in the process. Where traditional methods use coke - a fossil fuel - in a blast furnace at high temperatures, green steel manufacturing uses green hydrogen produced by water. Green steel production isn’t a cheap process because the process requires green hydrogen in abundance. Here’s the green hydrogen requirement from the top steel manufacturing country and the estimated renewable sources required. The Role of Green Hydrogen in Cement Manufacturing The global cement industry accounts for about . Cement is manufactured by a process that produces clinker - a mix of limestone and minerals heated in a kiln and transformed by this heat. When the limestone is converted to clinker, CO 2 is released, leading to enormous GHG emissions. So to decarbonize the manufacturing of cement, manufacturers need to capture this CO 2 emitted during clinker formation. The most promising method to do so is the (CCS), since it can address both process and energy emissions. But, capturing CO 2 emitted from the clinker generation process is expensive. That’s because to do so, manufacturers need to use an amine-based chemical absorption method that needs about 7 GJ/tCO 2 of energy. But apart from CCS, green hydrogen can also decarbonize the cement industry. It can help reduce the amount of clinker needed in cement production, as it can be used as a reducing agent in the raw material mix. Challenges to Fully Green Hydrogen Process Cost Producing green hydrogen is expensive. Based on an analysis of 2020, the cost of producing hydrogen using the proton exchange method was ~$5/kg when using renewable electricity. Apart from the process, the cost of electrolysis also depends on the cost of electricity used for the process itself. To achieve , which the DOE launched in June 2021, the cost of green hydrogen production must be lowered by 80%, which will take time. The scheme aims to reduce the production cost of green hydrogen to 1 USD per kilogram in 1 decade. Expensive Transportation Besides production, transportation is another major challenge in generating fully green hydrogen. You can transport hydrogen via pipeline or tube trailers, but it's extremely expensive. According to , the transportation cost of hydrogen from the place of production to fueling stations, including compressing and dispensing, is ~13 USD per Kg. Costly Electrolyzers The cost of electrolyzers is a significant challenge in green hydrogen production because they are a key component of the process and represent a large portion of the initial capital costs. An electrolyzer is a device that uses electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. The cost of electrolyzers is expensive because: The catalyst used in electrolyzers are often precious metals like platinum and are expensive Manufacturing electrolyzers itself is an expensive process Electrolyzers have a low lifespan and high maintenance costs Note: With all these factors, a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer costs around . Advancement in the Green Hydrogen Sector is Building a Power Plant that Can Run on Green Hydrogen: Entergy is building the in its fleet. This $1.5 billion project can run turbines on green hydrogen with zero carbon emission. Germans are on the Way to Building the World's Largest Hydrogen Grid: The German gas pipeline operators revealed a blueprint for the , covering around 5,900 kilometers (3,666 miles). EU Aims to Expand Hydrogen Use: to use hydrogen as fuel in the industrial application and mobility sectors. Their immediate goal is to replace fossil fuel-based hydrogen in refineries and partially replace fossil fuels in steelmaking. For the transportation industry, the EU aims to use green hydrogen for fueling city buses and heavy-duty vehicles. There are many other advancements every country is planning to maximize the use of green hydrogen, but it all boils down to if hydrogen can be produced at a lower cost utilizing renewable resources or not.

This algae-based footwear manufacturer makes sustainable shoes to save the planet.,"fights climate change through the manufacturing of sustainable footwear. The company’s manufacturing process replaces plastics with algae-based pellets, and their mission to stick to local manufacturing and locally sourced materials reduces emissions from shipping. I spoke with Co-founder & COO Ryan Hunt about the company, his career path leading him to this point, and plans for growing into a new-age manufacturer of sustainable shoes. Jacob Sheldon: Can you tell me about your company and its purpose? Ryan Hunt: Our company, , is known as the shoe loop. We specialize in sustainable and locally produced footwear. Our operations encompass the entire shoe manufacturing process, from design to mass production. Our primary focus lies in utilizing sustainable materials, implementing innovative manufacturing techniques, and creating distinctive designs. Our mission is to expedite the integration of sustainable materials and advanced recycling processes into the footwear industry's supply chain. Thanks for reading Warming Up to Climate Tech! Subscribe for free to learn more about climate tech every week. Subscribe Jacob: What motivated you to start Shloop? Ryan: Over the past 12 years, we have been at the forefront of sustainable materials derived from algae. Algae is an incredibly fast-growing organism, surpassing the growth rate of plants and trees. It plays a vital role in our environment, accounting for over half of the world's oxygen production and carbon sequestration. During this period, we founded Algix, a company dedicated to using algae biomass from environmental restoration projects to replace traditional plastics, foams, and rubber compounds. Our initial focus was on footwear brands, collaborating with industry leaders like Adidas, Vivo Barefoot, and Merrell, among others, starting around 2016. Today, we have expanded our reach, with over 100 footwear brands and over 400 footwear factories incorporating and selling our algae-based material. However, we discovered that most footwear brands do not manufacture their own shoes. Instead, the production is outsourced to Chinese-owned or Vietnamese-owned factories, with around 80 to 90% of shoe factories in China. This became a significant issue when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, leading to supply chain disruptions. Moreover, the trade war and tariffs between the US and China added further challenges to adopting our product in China's established supply chain. Despite the headwinds we faced in previous years, the impact of COVID-19 on the industry was profound. Many small and medium-sized brands struggled to manufacture shoes due to factory closures and other pandemic-related difficulties. During this crisis, we realized that our mission to revolutionize the footwear industry through algae-based materials was inextricably tied to convincing Chinese factory owners to embrace our product. It became clear that the best path forward was controlling our destiny. Thus, we established Shloop approximately two years ago. Since then, we have assembled a team of footwear experts with extensive experience in design, prototyping, scaling up, and high-level production innovation. Our vision is to build the footwear factory of the future, one that incorporates sustainable material libraries as a core component. Every shoe we create will be crafted from local and environmentally friendly materials. Additionally, we are integrating cutting-edge technology, including robotic and automated machines for cutting, stitching, sewing, molding, and assembly. We are also implementing state-of-the-art knitting machines and robotic knitting technology. By adopting these advancements, we strive to offer our customers a product we can confidently stand behind. The journey of Shloop originated from the challenges we encountered in manufacturing shoes in Asia and the realization that taking matters into our own hands would put us in a better position to serve our customers. Jacob: What is the current stage of development for Shloop? Ryan: Research and development remains integral to our daily operations as we construct the factory. We constantly engage in R&D activities, assessing new sustainable and innovative materials. Our experimentation extends to exploring alternative methods for 3D printing molds and tooling, allowing us to manufacture parts distinct from the current practices prevalent in Asia. One area of our focus is the production of insoles, midsoles, outsoles, and other components that form the core of a shoe. Typically, these rubbery parts present challenges as they are predominantly sourced from Asia, with limited availability from Italy and Portugal. However, we have developed a groundbreaking technology that significantly reduces costs while enhancing our speed and flexibility in designing and manufacturing new molds and parts. This breakthrough empowers us to progress from sampling and beta testing to full-scale production swiftly. We anticipate gaining a competitive advantage in the marketplace by pioneering this technology. Jacob: What did you do before Algix and Shloop? Ryan: I was a physics and bioengineering student. I earned my degrees from the University of Georgia, and in 2010, I started the first company called Algix out of the university. My work focused on converting algae into products, ultimately leading to the creation of 3D printing filament. We began producing filament made from algae and biodegradable bioplastic formulations in 2015. Later, we started collaborating with footwear brands, which required us to adjust our formula. Although we still produce PLA and biobased filament materials, we no longer extrude filament. Instead, we produce pellets in EVA formulations, or elastomers, which are more flexible and rubbery. These resin pellets are shipped to factories that convert them into either foam blocks or molded injection parts. With Shloop, we buy foam parts directly from Algix or one of their converters, and then we finish the shoe by cutting, assembling, and packaging it. Our business model is premium products through mainly wholesale, as we offer a Made in America alternative to the traditional Chinese-dominated supply chain. Jacob: What is the specific problem that Shloop is solving? Ryan: Shloop is addressing several issues in the supply chain, including the challenge that brands face in accessing transparent and sustainable products at a fair price. Traditionally, as a product is shipped to China and then converted in factories before being shipped again, the cost increases with each step. Due to the high demand for footwear manufacturing in China, it becomes challenging for brands to create unique and innovative products and get them through the supply chain. We provide the brands a sustainable and transparent product that they can rely on and obtain locally. We offer smaller batch runs, allowing them to start with as few as 1,000 pairs of shoes, and we also offer prototyping services. Their designers can work with our team without having to fly to China, which saves time and money. Our approach provides an environmental benefit and improves the manufacturing and distribution of shoes. It's a great way to combine sustainability with process improvement. Jacob: So, if I understand correctly, your solution for Bloom focuses on commercializing the Algix materials. Ryan: Yes, that's correct. We focus on getting Algix materials into the market through Bloom, our material brand. When we talk about the pellets, we refer to them as Bloom material. Using these materials to replace traditional plastics or pellets containing recycled content, we can create finished foams with over 50% recycled greenhouse film content. Depending on the end-use application, our different formulations can have varying algae levels, recycled content, and performance metrics. For high-performance applications, less algae may be used, while more can be added for lower-impact shoe parts, for example. Jacob: How would you describe your target customer? Ryan : We have identified footwear brands as our best-case customers. These brands, especially the big publicly traded ones, have reputations to uphold and are under increasing pressure to invest in environmentally friendly materials to reduce their carbon footprint and improve their ESG (Environmental Social Governance) policies. We secured Adidas as one of our first major adopters because they have been measuring their ESG and their shareholders are asking about how they're improving their carbon footprint. Using Bloom, our material brand, footwear brands can easily incorporate and improve their ESG metrics. However, it's important to note that the materials only make up about 30% of the impact of a shoe, while the manufacturing process accounts for almost 60%. We are working on solving the bigger sustainability problem these brands face, which includes the need for more transparency and high carbon footprint associated with manufacturing in China. Using sustainable materials and manufacturing locally, we can dramatically reduce the carbon footprint and create a product with a massive value proposition at a competitive price point. Our focus on footwear brands is because we can help solve a specific problem they have. Our solution is geared towards dramatically improving the efficiency and sustainability of footwear manufacturing. Jacob: Let's talk about sustainability. How do you measure and track your climate impact? Ryan: We quantify our environmental impact using the lifecycle assessment (LCA) method. We conducted two major LCA reports in 2014 and 2021 for the raw material at Algix, which underwent third-party peer review to evaluate the CO2 emissions, water ecosystem impacts, human health impacts, and energy impacts. We have peer-reviewed data for the raw material, but we're just starting for the factory, and it's more of an estimation until we optimize and refine our processes. Nonetheless, as we are a primary data provider, we plan to continue this work to provide accurate measurements for our customers and enhance their confidence in our data. We have attempted to obtain information from some Asian factories, but getting this kind of information is challenging. Jacob: It seems like the big footwear brands could really benefit from your work. How active have they been in supporting you? Ryan: They haven't been very active at all, to be honest. We're not even targeting the big brands at this point. It's too early for us to try to land a deal for a million pairs of shoes from one of the big companies. We're focusing on smaller to medium-sized brands instead. We've met with them, received letters of support, and have continued to receive feedback and calls from them. These are startups or small brands with some shoe experience, but we're not bringing in new people who have no idea what they're doing. Working on these types of projects helps us get our training wheels spinning and off the ground. Eventually, the big players may come knocking on our door, but we're still getting ready for them. Jacob: Tell me about your team. Ryan: We have a really cool team of 18 people now, which is quite a leap from the four of us less than a year ago. Our core team consists of some of the original members of Bloom Algix, including two co-founders and two former employees. We've combined that with two highly experienced footwear professionals: one specializing in luxury Italian craftsmanship and high-end products, with expertise in prototyping and turning design concepts into actual samples; the other, Peter, is a sneaker guru with experience in innovation, scaling up, and mass production, having worked for major brands such as Nike, Converse, Asics, Timberland and New Balance. By working together, we can seamlessly go from novel design concept to mass production without relying on external development and factories in China. This is because most footwear brands, especially recently, have lost a lot of their development expertise and instead rely on Asian factories to handle the details. This approach creates a lot of problems and limits creative possibilities. For example, if a design concept is outside the box and the factory doesn't want to figure out how to produce it, they may decline the project. This has happened to us before, but we push for more creative freedom and flexibility. We heavily rely on our two footwear experts to guide us since we've only been in the business for five or six years as a supplier. We were fortunate to find competent and high-quality stitching talent when the Lazy Boy factory closed in our town in Mississippi, and we're now almost 90 days into training them. They're picking it up and turning things around, which is a big factor for our success. We've also strategically brought in robotic technology for knitting and stitching to support the human workforce and take some pressure off them. This helps us make products consistently and without quality issues, especially for higher volume production. Our most recent initiative is training a team of a dozen shoe technicians in their early 20s to make shoes from scratch. These jobs are long gone, and we're excited to teach young people everything from designing and patterning to cutting, folding, cementing, stitching, lasting, and sewing. We have a creative team of men and women looking to scale up our efforts to make more sustainable and interesting local products. Jacob: How do you see your costs and margins scaling? Ryan: It's tough right now because we're just starting out. But once we get past this initial hurdle of setting up the factory, acquiring equipment, and fulfilling some orders, we can keep chipping away at costs by incorporating automation and efficiency-building software, particularly around our molding technology. As we become more self-sufficient and less reliant on importing soles and uppers, we can improve our cost position, making us more competitive with China. Even though our labor costs are higher, we can offset some of these inflationary costs by cleverly managing shipping costs, tariffs, and duties. Inflation in China is not going down, and as a result, we see the overall trajectory of cost upward. This makes it easier for us to hedge inflationary costs in China, maintain our competitive position, and make shoes that are unavailable in China. We can also customize and create unique shoes using new sustainable materials not widely available in Asia. So, even if we cost more, we provide a way better product than you can’t get from China, which is much more Italian than Chinese. We don't want to be an alternative to cheap products; we want to make premium, unparalleled, luxury products. Jacob: How much will the end consumer pay for your products? Ryan: That depends on the style and brand of the product. Our low-end products will range from $80 to $100 per pair, while our high-end products will be priced at $500, $1,000, or $2,000 per pair. We're designing limited-edition shoes, and working with celebrities and influencers. The prices vary depending on the product. Jacob: What is one thing your team does really well? Ryan: Well, because we're merging different philosophies, mindsets, and capabilities, we're ending up with something that is the key to innovation. It's not necessarily coming up with something totally new, which is more like research or invention. It's more like taking what we have here, what we have, and what we have over here and combining these proven elements into a new product that works differently. And that's what we've been doing. We've been merging classical Italian quality craftsmanship with robotics, automation, digitalization, 3D printing, natural materials, and disruptive design - designs that don't look like something you would find at DSW. They're very different. We're designing shoes that are still beautiful but just different. One of the key things we're doing right now is putting our own twist on things, which keeps us competitive. You won't see this in other China factories yet. Eventually, they may copy us, but we want to be the first. Since we're using interesting materials and have proprietary conversion technologies and processes, we can make things that can't be made any other way. We have exclusive licensing of this technology in the US and worldwide, which puts us in a very competitive spot in terms of making things that others can't do. Jacob : What's one thing you've struggled with and overcome? Ryan: It was the driving force behind the company's breakthrough in the status quo supply chain by getting factories in Asia to adopt our model. The development of our materials has brought us to this point where we are almost ready to open our factory. We have design studios here that make prototypes, and we have a range of shoe styles, some of which are normal-looking while others are more unique. However, our current struggle is getting brands to understand our vision. Some brands view us as a US-based Chinese factory replacement, which is not what we are. We want to be treated differently, and we want our customers to use our abilities to differentiate themselves. We have only talked to a few brands, selectively choosing those with a large portfolio. They could use what we offer to stand out and be competitive against their competitors. But, for this to work, they need to take the bait and try new things. Some brands want us to make a normal shoe at a low cost, but we question whether that's our best use of time. Educating our customers on our value proposition, including both the brands and retailers, is key. Once we are ready to go to market directly, we plan to build our own brand, which we have trademarked. We can't release the name yet, but the idea is the Black Swan - a small event that changes the course of history. That little nugget of information that changes everything is what we're after. Working with algae, we discovered its potential as a material for consumer products. Before, it was mostly an idea for biofuel or a spirulina supplement for smoothies. Now, over 100 brands use it daily in their products. However, adoption has been slower than we hoped, and we think Shloop is the next-level thing. It's in response to COVID-19, which disrupted our supply chain. We are developing a new manufacturing model that is different from anything done before. This will inspire others to do similar things and inspire footwear brands to rethink the possibilities of manufacturing, product design, and sustainability. Jacob: What's one piece of advice you have for other entrepreneurs? Ryan: I've always liked the Steve Jobs quote, ""Stay hungry and stay humble."" Starting a business is all about people, relationships, and a lot of hard work. Everyone wears many different hats and needs to be flexible, delivering results on multiple fronts. As a leader, it's essential to lead, not boss people around. Being humble is also important. From a business perspective, there's the 10x rule. Our business could try to make shoes the same way China does and maybe be successful, but we can't rely on doing things the same way as everyone else. To succeed, we need to find ways to be 10 times better, whether it's cutting faster, being more environmentally conscious, or having quicker time to market. The goal is to find that next order of magnitude on as many fronts as possible to differentiate ourselves and increase our chances of success. One good differentiation factor is great, but having several is even better. Jacob : What's currently keeping you up at night? Ryan: Right now, the delay in getting our occupancy permit for the factory is causing stress and anxiety. Once we're in the factory and everything is rolling, I'll be able to sleep better. However, my biggest concern is how to create an iconic product and build a brand around it. We don't want to make more cheap shoes; we want to make high-quality, beautiful shoes that people seek out. Our goal is to build a brand around disruption, sustainability, local manufacturing, and customized customer experiences. I think about this in the evenings - how to reach our ultimate potential and create a brand that truly stands out. If we can achieve this, then I'll be able to rest easier at night. Jacob : What’s the biggest challenge you’re facing right now? Ryan: Raising capital is always the toughest one for us. The markets have been weird, and after starting a company and meeting customers and brands, getting grants, and doing a bunch of stuff, we went to the bank to fund our sneaker factory. However, getting traditional banks to fund us took a lot of work. They saw us as just a startup company and said we needed to find a VC to partner with because they were not our partners. Being in a conservative area like Mississippi, we struggled and it took us a year and a half to finally get funded. We were fortunate to have angel backers who were interested in what we stood for and liked what we were doing to invest into growing the local community. The next challenge is hiring and training the right people and ensuring we have the proper operational policies and standardized processes to get the job done. Jacob: What is your overall vision for the company? Ryan: The mission of Shloop is to accelerate the adoption of sustainable materials and technologies for footwear manufacturing, and that's really our main goal. Jacob: What’s the best way for people to connect with you? Ryan: You can connect with us on our and find me on .

Subscribe for free to learn more about climate tech every week. Subscribe Jacob: What motivated you to start Shloop? Ryan: Over the past 12 years, we have been at the forefront of sustainable materials derived from algae. Algae is an incredibly fast-growing organism, surpassing the growth rate of plants and trees. It plays a vital role in our environment, accounting for over half of the world's oxygen production and carbon sequestration. During this period, we founded Algix, a company dedicated to using algae biomass from environmental restoration projects to replace traditional plastics, foams, and rubber compounds. Our initial focus was on footwear brands, collaborating with industry leaders like Adidas, Vivo Barefoot, and Merrell, among others, starting around 2016. Today, we have expanded our reach, with over 100 footwear brands and over 400 footwear factories incorporating and selling our algae-based material. However, we discovered that most footwear brands do not manufacture their own shoes. Instead, the production is outsourced to Chinese-owned or Vietnamese-owned factories, with around 80 to 90% of shoe factories in China. This became a significant issue when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, leading to supply chain disruptions.

It's in response to COVID-19, which disrupted our supply chain. We are developing a new manufacturing model that is different from anything done before. This will inspire others to do similar things and inspire footwear brands to rethink the possibilities of manufacturing, product design, and sustainability. Jacob: What's one piece of advice you have for other entrepreneurs? Ryan: I've always liked the Steve Jobs quote, ""Stay hungry and stay humble."" Starting a business is all about people, relationships, and a lot of hard work. Everyone wears many different hats and needs to be flexible, delivering results on multiple fronts. As a leader, it's essential to lead, not boss people around. Being humble is also important. From a business perspective, there's the 10x rule. Our business could try to make shoes the same way China does and maybe be successful, but we can't rely on doing things the same way as everyone else. To succeed, we need to find ways to be 10 times better, whether it's cutting faster, being more environmentally conscious, or having quicker time to market. The goal is to find that next order of magnitude on as many fronts as possible to differentiate ourselves and increase our chances of success. One good differentiation factor is great, but having several is even better. Jacob : What's currently keeping you up at night? Ryan: Right now, the delay in getting our occupancy permit for the factory is causing stress and anxiety. Once we're in the factory and everything is rolling, I'll be able to sleep better. However, my biggest concern is how to create an iconic product and build a brand around it. We don't want to make more cheap shoes; we want to make high-quality, beautiful shoes that people seek out. Our goal is to build a brand around disruption, sustainability, local manufacturing, and customized customer experiences. I think about this in the evenings - how to reach our ultimate potential and create a brand that truly stands out. If we can achieve this, then I'll be able to rest easier at night. Jacob : What’s the biggest challenge you’re facing right now? Ryan: Raising capital is always the toughest one for us. The markets have been weird, and after starting a company and meeting customers and brands, getting grants, and doing a bunch of stuff, we went to the bank to fund our sneaker factory. However, getting traditional banks to fund us took a lot of work. They saw us as just a startup company and said we needed to find a VC to partner with because they were not our partners. Being in a conservative area like Mississippi, we struggled and it took us a year and a half to finally get funded. We were fortunate to have angel backers who were interested in what we stood for and liked what we were doing to invest into growing the local community. The next challenge is hiring and training the right people and ensuring we have the proper operational policies and standardized processes to get the job done. Jacob: What is your overall vision for the company? Ryan: The mission of Shloop is to accelerate the adoption of sustainable materials and technologies for footwear manufacturing, and that's really our main goal. Jacob: What’s the best way for people to connect with you? Ryan: You can connect with us on our and find me on .

Warming Up to Climate Tech,How to Decarbonize the Global Electric Grid,"25% of global emissions come from generating electricity, making decarbonization of the electric grid one of the biggest hurdles to reaching net zero.","1882 was the year Thomas Edison built Pearl Street Station in New York. The station provided direct current (DC) electricity to nearby homes and businesses. Sir Charles Parsons in the UK and George Westinghouse in the US began experimenting with alternating current (AC). That’s because DC has the drawback of substantial electricity losses when transmitted over long distances. The 1900s was the time of the industrial revolution when factories sprung up within and around cities to manufacture goods. Electricity became necessary to run these plants, and AC electric grids expanded. This was when engineers like Nikola Tesla and Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky revolutionized electricity generation and the first transformer was made. Despite an exponential increase in electricity demand, rural areas were still electricity-deprived. In 1935, the United States founded the Rural Electrification Administration (REA), which helped expand electricity infrastructure in rural areas. Similar administrations formed across the globe, and 1920-1940 became the phase of expansion of electricity to rural areas. As power grids expanded, the need for more efficient long-distance transmission grew. Substations allowed the interconnection of regional grids, creating national and international networks: this increased power grid reliability and the ability to transfer electricity across large distances. In the 1980s and 1990s, many countries began deregulating their electricity markets, allowing competition among companies. This market liberalization aimed to promote efficiency and drive down consumer electricity prices. In the 21st century, has become the focus of many, and governments are working on finding solutions to integrate renewable energy sources into their electric grids. The environmental concern has led to the development of smart grids, which use advanced information and communication technologies to balance supply and demand, optimize energy usage, and manage distributed energy resources.

Subscribe Why Do We Need to Decarbonize Power Grids? #1. Non-Renewable Resources Generate The Majority of Electricity Non-renewable sources - gas and coal, generate more than 50% of electricity worldwide. Relying blindly on fossil fuels and exploiting them has several adverse effects: Extracting, transporting, and burning fossil fuel is the main reason for environmental destruction, pollution, and release of greenhouse gases. The basis of today’s economy is fossil fuels, and hundreds of thousands of jobs rely on their extraction and use. This dependence makes economies vulnerable to fluctuations in fossil fuel prices and geopolitical tensions that can disrupt supply. Health issues come from air pollution caused by burning fossil fuels, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. By transitioning to clean energy sources, the world can improve public health outcomes and reduce the burden on healthcare systems. #2. Greenhouse Gas Emissions Continue to Grow The increase in the emission of greenhouse gases is due to two main reasons: Increased fossil fuel dependency Increased deforestation due to the rise in population The main side-effect of higher emissions is increased global temperature, causing numerous environmental changes that disrupt our lives and ecosystems all over the planet. The best way to reduce the CO 2 emission rates is by accelerating the shift towards renewable energy, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. #3. Enhancing Energy Security Enhancing energy security through a diversified and decarbonized energy mix is essential for reducing the risks associated with fossil fuel dependency. By diversifying energy sources and transitioning towards cleaner alternatives, countries can achieve greater stability, economic growth, and environmental sustainability. How to Decarbonize the Global Electric Grid Step #1: Reach 50-60% Decarbonization Through the Expansion of Renewable Energy Achieving 50-60% decarbonization of the power system by 2040 can be accomplished with minimal additional investment, as solar and wind power and storage costs have dropped significantly. Solar-plus storage can ensure a steady power supply, and the complementary nature of solar and wind energy helps manage intermittency in markets with both resources. This level of decarbonization would not significantly impact the power system's performance or the utilization of fossil fuel plants, and little new transmission infrastructure would be required. The power system would undergo minimal changes to reach 50-60% decarbonization. Step #2: Reach 80-90% Decarbonization With Better Energy Storage We'll have 80-90% decarbonization of the power system by 2040. No new technologies are needed, but longer storage periods and tighter demand management, such as active building heating and cooling management. Some markets may need new transmission interconnections to pool renewable assets and share baseload resources. Fossil fuel plants will operate less (20-35%) but remain available when renewables cannot meet demand. Step #3: Reach 100% Decarbonization With New Tech and Carbon Capture Achieving 100% decarbonization of the power system by 2040 is complex and could cost 25% more than the lowest-cost option. The focus will be on filling longer-duration gaps. Some existing technologies that could help build a 100% decarbonized power system include: Biofuels: Expensive and limited in supply, they can serve as part of the solution in most cases. : Proven but expensive, it requires technological improvements and scale efficiencies. Best suited for highly interconnected markets. Bioenergy Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS): A relatively new technology generating negative emissions. There are uncertainties regarding the scalability of biomass and the extent to which retired coal plants can be converted into BECCS plants. Power to Gas to Power (P2G2P): The process enables long-duration storage but is expensive and inefficient. Its flexibility could help integrate intermittent renewables if there's demand for clean gas outside the power sector. Compared to 80-90% decarbonization, for 100% decarbonization, fossil-fuel-plant utilization would need to fall sharply (to 4-6%). Each region must get its net carbon emissions to zero using biofuels, P2G2P technology, or additional offsets. Progress So Far #1. Lower Emissions In just 15 years, the US power sector has significantly reduced emissions, with 2020's direct power-sector CO 2 emissions at 1,450 MMT, 52% lower than the 2005 projection by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). The 2020 results were influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a 4% reduction in electricity demand compared to 2019. In 2019, emissions were 46% lower than EIA’s earlier projections and the post-pandemic emission (2020) were 40% less than the emission in 2005. This demonstrates that the US power sector has made considerable progress towards decarbonization. #2. Advancement in Technology and Federal Policies Policy, market, and technology factors have driven emissions reductions in the US power sector. Electricity demand in 2020 was 24% lower than projected due to economic changes, sectoral shifts, and energy efficiency improvements. Thanks to technological advancements and supportive policies, wind and solar generation exceeded expectations, delivering 13x more energy than projected. Renewable energy supply, including hydropower, biomass, and geothermal, was 79% higher than projected. Additionally, the coal-to-gas fuel switch played a significant role. Natural gas generation increased rapidly due to the shale gas revolution and differences in fuel prices compared to projections. #3. Lower Health and Climate Burden The positive effects of reduced electricity supply on climate and health are significant. Climate damages from power-sector carbon emissions in 2020 were $110 billion, less than half of the $229 billion projected by EIA. Health costs were reduced by over 90%, from a projected $419 billion to $34 billion, due to lower coal generation and stricter emissions regulations. Premature deaths from power-sector air pollution in 2020 were just 8% of the projected number under the business-as-usual trajectory. Overall, the social cost of power supply in 2020, considering electricity bills, climate damages, and health impacts, was 44% lower than in 2005 and 52% lower than projected for 2020. Present and Future Tech Needed and Being Developed to Decarbonize Electric Grid #1. Renewable Energy Generation Solar photovoltaic (PV) panels: Harnessing energy from the sun to produce electricity Wind turbines: Generating electricity by converting the kinetic energy from wind Hydropower: Producing electricity from the gravitational force of falling or flowing water Geothermal energy: Harnessing the Earth's heat to generate electricity Biomass and bioenergy: Converting organic matter into electricity and heat #2. Energy Storage Systems Battery storage: Storing energy from renewables or off-peak periods in lithium-ion, solid-state, flow batteries, or other advanced battery technologies Pumped hydroelectric storage: Storing energy by pumping water uphill into reservoirs and releasing it during peak demand Compressed air energy storage: Storing energy by compressing air into underground caverns and releasing it to generate electricity Thermal energy storage: Storing heat or cold in materials like molten salts, concrete, or ice for later use in generating electricity #3. Grid Modernization and Smart Grids Advanced grid management systems: Utilizing digital technology and real-time data to optimize grid operations, maintain stability, and balance supply and demand. Demand response programs: Encouraging customers to reduce or shift their electricity use during peak demand periods. Microgrids and distributed energy resources: Creating smaller, localized grids with diverse energy sources that can operate independently or in conjunction with the main grid. Grid-scale energy storage: Large-scale deployment of energy storage systems to stabilize the grid and support the integration of intermittent renewable energy sources. #4. Power-to-X Technologies Power-to-gas: Converting excess electricity from renewables into or other gases, which can be stored and used later for electricity generation or in other sectors like transportation and industry. Power-to-liquids: Using excess renewable electricity to produce synthetic fuels or chemicals. #5. Advanced Nuclear Power Small modular reactors (SMRs): Developing compact, factory-built reactors with improved safety and cost-efficiency. Advanced reactor designs: Researching and developing new reactor technologies, such as molten salt reactors, high-temperature gas-cooled reactors, and fusion energy, that offer increased safety, efficiency, and reduced waste. #6. Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) Carbon capture: Capturing CO2 emissions from fossil fuel-based power plants and other industrial sources. Utilization: Converting captured CO2 into valuable products like chemicals, fuels, or building materials. Storage: Safely and permanently storing captured CO2 in geological formations. Policy changes needed #1. Phasing Out Fossil Fuel Subsidies Phasing out fossil fuel subsidies involves reducing or eliminating financial support provided by governments to the production, consumption, and distribution of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Redirecting these subsidies to clean energy alternatives and energy efficiency improvements can accelerate the transition to a low-carbon energy system. #2. Implementing Carbon Pricing Mechanisms Implementing carbon pricing mechanisms is a critical strategy for incentivizing the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and promoting investment in cleaner technologies. Carbon pricing mechanisms, such as carbon taxes and cap-and-trade systems, assign a cost to carbon emissions, making it more expensive for businesses and individuals to emit greenhouse gases. This encourages the adoption of low-carbon alternatives and drives innovation in clean energy solutions. #3. Investing in Renewable Energy and Clean Technologies Investing in renewable energy and clean technologies is crucial for accelerating the transition to a low-carbon energy system and decarbonizing the electric grid. Increasing public and private investment in research, development, and deployment of clean energy technologies, such as renewable generation, energy storage, advanced nuclear power, and carbon capture and storage, can help drive innovation, reduce costs, and improve the performance of these technologies. #4. Strengthening Grid Infrastructure Strengthening grid infrastructure is essential for facilitating the transition to a low-carbon energy system and decarbonizing the electric grid. Upgrading and modernizing the electricity grid enables the integration of a higher share of renewable energy sources, increases energy efficiency, and improves the overall resiliency of the grid. Investing in grid infrastructure ensures a reliable and secure electricity supply while supporting the large-scale deployment of clean energy technologies. #5. Encouraging Distributed Energy Resources and Microgrids Support the development and deployment of distributed energy resources (DERs), such as rooftop solar panels, small-scale wind turbines, and microgrids that can enhance grid resilience and flexibility.

Warming Up to Climate Tech,Beni Makes Secondhand Shopping Seamless,,"Beni reduces carbon emissions from the clothing industry through its easy-to-use browser extension (available on Chrome & Safari). The company is augmenting online shopping experiences by seamlessly surfacing re-sale items identical or similar to what you’re looking at on a retailer’s website. I spoke with Co-founder & CEO, Sarah Pinner, about her startup journey so far, passion for the climate, and Beni’s success. Jacob Sheldon: What does Beni do? Sarah Pinner: Beni's goal is to make resale the new norm. Our free browser extension helps you easily find and buy second-hand clothes online. You can shop on any brand’s website, such as Nike.com, and find a pair of shoes you like. Then, the Beni browser extension will show you where that shoe exists secondhand online. We partner with about 40 resale marketplaces, including Poshmark, eBay, and The RealReal, to aggregate the entire resale world and bring it directly to your browser. Thanks for reading Warming Up to Climate Tech! Subscribe for free to learn more about climate tech every month. Subscribe Jacob: Why did you choose a browser extension instead of another way to do this? Sarah: The browser extension came out of the core insight that started Beni. I had been talking to people, and they would say something like, ""I know I should buy secondhand, but I just don't."" I was intrigued by the fact that people clearly understood the value of secondhand but still weren’t actually buying secondhand. They're like, ""Yeah, it's cheaper and more sustainable, but I don't want to scroll on eBay for three hours. I don't want to open up 20 tabs, and just generally speaking, I don't want to learn a new way of shopping."" We refer to this shopper as the “aspirational secondhand shopper”, somebody who is open to resale but not yet doing it. Instead of trying to pull them into resale, the browser extension allows us to bring resale to them and integrate it into their existing clothes shopping. Jacob: It makes sense from a user perspective, but are you concerned about retail companies blocking Beni from being used on their sites? Sarah: No, we haven't had any issues. We're still relatively small, so it could happen, but it's challenging to block an extension. That said, we have been focusing more on how we can be supportive of brands in their resale strategy. We are in a time where people are increasingly aware that recommerce is here to stay, and brands know they need a strategy around it. We're now starting to have more direct relationships with them where we can ask questions like, ""Do you have a resale site, and can we support that via the extension? Are you thinking about having a resale site? Can we provide you with insights?"" There are a lot of things that we can help brands with, and our goal is to build a win-win relationship with all players in recommerce. Jacob: You said recommerce is here to stay. Why is that? Sarah: There are several factors that contribute to this. First, resale is now generally accepted. The stigma is largely gone due to increasing awareness of climate change, the need to reduce waste, and younger generations' desire for commerce to look different in the future. Buying secondhand also presents a lot of cost-saving opportunities. Inflation has become a driving factor in recent years, making it more appealing to buy resale. With younger generations, it's almost a point of pride to buy something secondhand. Second, companies like Poshmark, Thredup, The RealReal, and other online resale companies have made resale easily available online. Our goal at Beni is to bridge the gap between ecommerce and recommerce, so that buying secondhand becomes just as accessible as buying something new online. Jacob: What led you to start Beni personally? Sarah: I've always been passionate about sustainability and problem-solving. While working with startups at Rabobank early in my career, I always wanted to be on the other side of the table - where the entrepreneur sat - because I wanted to solve problems for customers. I was fascinated by the problem of waste and when I went to work at Imperfect Foods I saw first-hand the opportunity to make the more sustainable and circular option attractive, convenient, and affordable. I took that lens and went to business school, where I had conversations with people about the intention-action gap in resale, and this led me to start Beni. Jacob: While having these conversations, were you intending to find something to work on or just having a general conversation? Sarah: While I wasn’t intending to start a company, I was always looking for opportunities to develop solutions to the problem of waste. So when I started having a lot of conversations about the friction points in resale, I had to dig in. Specifically, I first developed the idea for Beni through an MBA case competition. After that, we built Beni step by step, always focused on the big question we needed to answer next. Instead of starting a business and then finding a problem to solve, we started with the problem. Jacob: Could you describe the specific problem that you're solving? Sarah: The problem we are solving is the intention-action gap. Research shows that a lot of shoppers have the intention to shop more sustainably and are open to buying secondhand, but they are not doing it. For many people, secondhand shopping “feels like a crapshoot,” as one user put it, because it takes too much time and energy to find what they are looking for. There are too many hurdles. Research shows that 80 to 90% of people are open to buying secondhand, but only about 50% actually do it. Our goal with the browser extension is to remove the hurdles when shopping secondhand. We are first focused on solving the search and discovery challenge - making it super easy to find and buy clothes secondhand. Going forward, our aim is to make buying resale as easy as buying new, so that it becomes a default option. Jacob: During your journey creating the product behind the extension, what roadblocks did you run into and how did you overcome them? Sarah: We knew that secondhand data was going to be messy, but it was messier than we thought. Being able to make it usable took a lot of infrastructure to ingest and normalize the feeds, and then use AI to provide alternatives because there is no SKU information (all thanks to our amazing engineers and my co-founder, Celine). We spent a lot of time last year on the core infrastructure and backend, which was not a blocker, but it took a lot of time. There are challenges with browser extensions as well, as they have lower adoption rates compared to an app, and there are high barriers related to data privacy. We are building our brand and user trust to ensure that they feel comfortable using our tool. Jacob: Considering your target market, how large is the market and can you quantify it? Sarah: According to thredUPs 2023 resale report, the global resale market is expected to be a $350 billion market in 2027, with the US market alone expected to be $70 billion by 2027. By 2027, resale is expected to grow nine times faster than the broader clothing retail sector. Moreover, 60% of the growth in the US is expected to come from new shoppers entering the market - a $20 billion value. Beni is focused on those new shoppers and creating an excellent experience to bring them into the market. Jacob: What's your business model to monetize that? Sarah: Our current business model is an affiliate model where we earn commission on purchases made through Beni. We have expertise in the affiliate space on our team, including our COO who comes from Honey, another successful browser extension. Jacob: Tell me about your team, who is on it and why is each person on the team? Sarah: We have a team of 11 full-time employees, including three contractors, with the majority being engineers. We also have one partnerships manager who manages our resale marketplace partners, and one product manager who manages the core product. Our leadership team is all-female, including myself as the CEO, my co-founder Celine as the CTO, our CMO Kate, and our COO Ryan. Our combination of experiences, including expertise in software engineering, environmental science, branding, and business, is one of the reasons why I'm excited about our team and the journey we're on with Beni. Celine is an environmental science expert and software engineer who joined Beni early on. Her background in both areas makes her an asset to the team. Kate, our CMO, has experience building strong brands, having previously launched Bud Light Seltzer at ABN Bev. Ryan, our COO, brings expertise from Honey and has her own upcycled clothing line. Together, our team has a great combination of skills and knowledge that touch on all aspects of the product, business, environmental science, and fashion industries we operate in. Jacob: What's been Beni's traction so far? Sarah: We've raised a Pre-seed in October 2021 and a Seed last November, raising a total of $5 million. As mentioned, our focus has been on building our core tech and relationships with resale marketplaces. Last year, we started with just two resale marketplaces as partners and now we have about 40, so we grew a lot. We continue to build relationships with other marketplaces and receive a lot of inbound interest. From a user standpoint, we launched publicly last September and have been growing organically around 20% to 40% month over month, now at around 7,000 users. As we move forward, our focus is on growing our user base through our core product and core relationships. Jacob: How have you grown the user base so far and how do you plan to grow it? Sarah: Our growth so far has mainly been organic, and our strategy has been to position Beni as a unique tool that fills a whitespace in the conversation around resale. There is a lot of talk about fast fashion being bad, and how people should use secondhand to shop more sustainably. But Beni is the first tool that actually helps people shop secondhand. Our goal is for Beni to be part of every conversation happening around this topic. Another unique way we can grow is through cross-promotion with our partners. It's a win-win situation, the more people that download Beni, the more people we can bring to their site. Moving forward, we plan to continue with our organic strategy while layering on some paid growth through various digital channels. Jacob: Do your partnerships with retailers only involve the affiliate side, or does it extend beyond that? Sarah: Our partnerships do not yet really involve the mainline site retailers. We’ve focused on partnering with third-party resellers like Poshmark, for example. Our partnership with them includes the affiliate commission aspect as well as access to their data feed. This access to data is crucial in allowing us to build our products. Jacob: I wonder if there is a path to even partnering with the retailer themselves, not the reseller, in giving some kind of sustainability play. I'm sure most, if not all, the big ones have sustainability goals. Does this contribute to their sustainability goals and bring you more users without directly removing customers from their sites? Sarah: I think it's a great point and one we’re thinking a lot about. We have started to work more closely with some brands and retailers. For example, we have a pilot program with Patagonia, where listings from their resale site, Worn Wear, are surfaced in Beni. We want to continue to work with other brands who have their own resale site so we can bring people to those brand-owned sites. The brand-owned resale market is new and developing and we are excited to help accelerate it. If resale is going to become the new norm, brands have to play a role in it. Jacob: How do you quantify your impact on the climate? Sarah: Currently, we leverage the fact that by buying something secondhand and keeping it in use, you are reducing the impact on the environment by keeping it out of the landfill, adding uses to the item, and eliminating the creation of a new item. To capture these nuances, we use LCA data from Green Story / thredUP to estimate the benefits of buying different garments secondhand in terms of carbon, water, and energy savings. We show our users the savings generated from a climate perspective when they make a secondhand purchase instead of buying new. It’s important to note that there are nuances to consider, such as whether it's a one-to-one displacement, if brands are reducing their net production, and whether the item ends up in the landfill even after one extra use. As we continue to grow, we want to be very thoughtful and nuanced about how we think of its impact because there's no silver bullet. Jacob: Do you also consider the impact of shipping or do you assume it would be shipped anyway? Sarah: The LCA model we use does incorporate transportation. I’ll note that this LCA is specifically for thredUP’s model, where they ship from warehouses, so it might be different for peer-to-peer models but it’s directionally accurate. Going forward, we're excited to also add to the body of data from an impact perspective. For example, we can help improve assumptions around the displacement rate. The question is: By buying this jacket secondhand, did you not purchase a new jacket? Because we're a browser extension, we could ask users’ permission to track all purchases, new and secondhand, over time to see what the displacement rate is. For example, let's say you made ten purchases in March, and 100% of them are new. In June, you made ten purchases, but 2% were still made secondhand. That would show that we're actually displacing new purchases and adopting more used items. Jacob: Have you considered refurbishing high-emission products like leather to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills? Sarah: As a software company, we haven't directly thought about refurbishing products. However, our goal is to accelerate the circular economy, which involves many layers, including resale, refurbishment, and recycling. Recently, I talked to someone from Hemster, which has an infrastructure for repairs and refurbishment. We are exploring ways to collaborate and give products new life. We need to make it accessible and convenient for people to choose the circular option instead of the linear one of buying fast fashion and throwing it in the trash. As we grow, we want to explore other opportunities beyond resale to contribute to the circular economy. Jacob: What's one thing that your company does well? Sarah: We have many strengths, but the one that stands out is our ability to understand our users and partners. We have unique insights into the needs and behaviors of our customers. From the beginning, our goal has been to help shoppers meet their needs in a more sustainable and affordable way. Additionally, we have built strong partnerships with resale marketplaces, which has allowed us to create the largest aggregated database of online resale. By understanding the challenges faced by our partners, we have been able to help them overcome those obstacles and build a strong position in the market. Overall, our ability to understand the needs of those we serve has been a key strength for our company. Jacob: What's one thing that you've struggled with? Sarah: In general, we struggle with moving fast with intention. Our model, both as a VC-backed business and from an impact perspective, requires scale. We want to encourage millions of people to buy one more thing secondhand, rather than 100 people buying everything secondhand. We're constantly trying to move fast, but at the same time, we want to ensure that Beni makes resale a more beautiful and awesome experience. We need to put a lot of intention behind the product. Also, as we continue to grow, we’ve found that paid marketing attribution is challenging for our product because we don't own where you download or where you make your purchase. Connecting all the dots to understand who we are acquiring and who is using our product has been difficult, and it's something that I never expected. Jacob: What's one piece of advice you have for other entrepreneurs? Sarah: My main advice for entrepreneurs is to take every piece of advice with a grain of salt. It's important to recognize patterns in advice and trust your gut. When I started building Beni, I would get conflicting advice from different people, and it made me realize that I needed to ask multiple trusted sources and weigh the feedback. It's important to get advice, but it's also important to have the internal ability to say, ""This advice doesn't sit well with me, and it's not what I've heard elsewhere."" So, my main piece of advice is to seek advice, but ultimately, trust your own judgment. Jacob: What's the most persistent issue you've faced since starting Beni? Sarah: Driving behavior change is hard; getting people to purchase secondhand who do not currently do so is hard. If our goal is to make resale as easy as buying new, there are a lot of friction points to solve for. We solved the first challenge: Helping users find the right item to buy. But there's always another challenge when seeking parity between ecommerce and recommerce - like not being able to return resale items, uncertainty about sizing, or concerns about authenticity. It's like peeling back an onion to find the next hurdle that’s blocking someone from buying secondhand. Jacob: What is your overall goal for the company? Sarah: Our highest-order purpose is to transform the norms of consumption. First and foremost, we aim to make resale the new norm. We want millions of people to buy at least one secondhand item that they wouldn't have otherwise bought. We often think about a study conducted by Global Fashion Agenda and McKinsey several years ago, which estimated that in order for the fashion industry to stay in line with a 1.5-degree target, one in five garments would need to be traded through circular business models by 2031. This is significantly more than current levels, but it's still only one in five, and our goal is to make a significant impact towards achieving this now. Jacob: What is the current level? Sarah: It's hard to estimate, but I would say that the current level of the resale market is around 5% of the clothing retail market. So it's definitely not where we want it to be, but it's also not unattainable. And I think that when you encourage people to buy at least one item secondhand out of every five purchases, it can make a huge impact. Our goal is really about progress over perfection and making it so that buying new is not the default option. We want to ensure that there's easy access to both options. Jacob: Compared to a lot of the other goals needed to reach net zero as a society, just quadrupling something like the resale market from 5% to 20% doesn't seem so daunting. Sarah: It's pretty attainable. Of course, we'd love to aim higher than that. But I think understanding what drives behavior change is difficult. Changing behaviors is hard. But when you consider the alternative of having to live in a bunker and not enjoy anything, shifting how we procure clothing seems like a small change. There is still a lot of beauty in the world, and we want to preserve that beauty while reducing the negative impacts of our consumption. Jacob: What's the best way for people to connect with you? Sarah: The best way to connect with Beni is through or on Instagram at . As for me, you can find me on LinkedIn under .

Warming Up to Climate Tech,Home Electrification Fights Climate Change,The concept of replacing gas-powered appliances with electric ones is taking off as homeowners reduce their carbon footprint and save money at the sameÉ,"As the global transition to clean energy gains momentum, home electrification is scaling up to meet increasing demands for sustainable living. This shift brings exciting new opportunities in residential energy solutions, transforming how we power, heat, and cool our homes while reducing carbon emissions and enhancing energy efficiency. Why Home Electrification is Taking Off Though home electrification isn’t the only solution to reverse climate change, it’s a significant one. Electrifying homes, which involves replacing fossil fuel-based systems with electric-powered ones, can contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Here's how home electrification plays a crucial role in mitigating climate change: : As more electricity is generated from renewable sources such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power, the overall carbon footprint of the electrical grid decreases. Home electrification enables households to take advantage of this cleaner energy, thereby reducing the overall emissions associated with their energy use. Energy Efficiency: Electric appliances and systems are generally more energy-efficient than those powered by fossil fuels. For example, electric heat pumps are more efficient than traditional gas or oil furnaces. By using energy more efficiently, households can reduce their overall consumption and associated emissions. Electric Stoves: Offer a cleaner, healthier, and more efficient cooking solution than gas stoves by eliminating pollutant emissions, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and providing superior energy efficiency, potentially saving millions of dollars in electricity costs. Heating and Cooling Electrification: Heating and cooling account for a significant portion of residential energy use. Electrifying these systems through heat pumps or electric heaters can reduce the demand for natural gas and other fossil fuels. Electric Vehicles: As households switch to electric vehicles (EVs), they can charge them using electricity generated from renewable sources. This helps to reduce the emissions associated with transportation. Smart Grid Technology: Home electrification can be integrated with smart grid technologies, enabling better demand management and stability. These technologies can help balance energy supply and demand, reducing the need for additional fossil fuel generation during periods of high demand. Distributed Energy Generation: Home electrification can also facilitate the adoption of distributed energy generation, such as rooftop solar panels. This allows households to generate their own clean electricity and reduce the load on the grid, further decreasing reliance on fossil fuel-based power generation.

Subscribe Healthy Home and Living Environment Gas stoves are the main reason for polluted air inside your homes. Did you know that homes with gas stoves have nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) concentrations that are 50-400% higher than in homes with electric stoves? Besides NO 2 , pollutants like carbon monoxide (CO) and formaldehyde from the gas stove lead to respiratory problems like asthma. There is a chance of of children suffering from asthma if their home uses a gas stove compared to homes with electric stoves. Electric Appliances are Comparatively Less Expensive than Fossil Fuel Appliances Recently, RMI analyzed and compared the cost of all-electric and mixed-fuel homes. In New York City, an all-electric home saves $6,800 in net present costs and 46 tons of CO 2 emissions over a 15-year period. The primary reason mixed fuel homes are expensive is that they have gas furnaces, water heaters, air conditioning, and new gas connections (which carry a median price tag of nearly ). Whereas, if we talk about an all-electric home, it uses a single heat pump system for both heating and cooling. Heat pumps are also more efficient than gas heaters and coolers and generate less electricity, leading to electric cost savings. Electrification will Decrease Carbon Emission Due to Appliances at Home Residential properties are responsible for ~17-21% of energy-related carbon emissions globally. To decrease this, one thing to do is start using renewable energy sources. As the proportion of renewable energy sources in the electricity grid increases, the overall carbon intensity of the electricity supply decreases. Home electrification ensures that appliances at home rely on this cleaner electricity, leading to lower carbon emissions. Home electrification often goes hand-in-hand with the adoption of more energy-efficient appliances. Modern electric appliances, such as heat pumps for heating and cooling, induction cooktops, and electric water heaters, are designed to use electricity more efficiently than their fossil fuel counterparts, which results in reduced energy consumption. Apart from this, you can combine home electrification projects with energy efficiency upgrades to the building envelope, such as insulation, air sealing, and window replacements. This can reduce energy consumption for heating and cooling, further reducing carbon emissions associated with residential energy use. 3 Major Incentives for Home Electrification by US Government State and Tribal Allocation For Home Energy Rebate Program The Biden-Harris administration has announced nearly in funding for states and Tribes to implement consumer home energy rebate programs through the . These programs aim to make homes more energy-efficient, promote electric appliances, and cut energy costs. The DOE estimates these rebates will save households $1 billion annually. Here’s what the program will include: Rebates for complete house and buildings Rebates for energy efficiency retrofits range from $2,000-$4,000 for individual households and far more for multifamily buildings. States to provide rebates for home retrofits: Get a rebate of up to $2,000 for retrofits reducing energy consumption by 20% or more, and up to $4,000 for 35% energy saving High-efficiency electric home rebate program to: The government is planning to develop a high-efficiency home rebate program for tribes with an allocated budget of $225 million Clean Energy for All - The White House Act aims at lowering energy costs and promoting clean energy adoption. This legislation provides incentives and rebates to make energy-efficient upgrades more accessible for consumers and small businesses. Here are some home upgrades and rebates you must know about: Rooftop Solar: Tax credits cover 30% of installation costs, potential state incentives, and average savings of $300 per year or $9,000 over the system life. Insulation and Air Sealing: Tax credits and rebates for energy-efficient home improvements, including home energy audits to identify optimal upgrades. Clothes Dryer: Rebates covering up to 100% of costs for purchasing and installing electric heat pump clothes dryers, depending on household eligibility. Electric Stove or Oven: Rebates cover up to 100% of the costs for electric stoves, cooktops, ranges, and ovens, depending on household eligibility. Weatherized Windows & Doors: Tax credits and rebates for energy-efficient windows and doors, plus coverage for home energy audits. Breaker Box: Tax credits and rebates for upgrading home breaker boxes or electrical wiring. Electric Vehicle: Tax credits up to $7,500 for new electric vehicles and $4,000 for used electric vehicles, with average annual fuel savings of $950. Federal Income Tax Credits and Incentives for Energy Efficiency The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 offers various to encourage energy-efficient upgrades for homes and commercial buildings. Homeowners can receive up to $3,200 annually in tax credits for energy-efficient home improvements and clean energy equipment. Home builders benefit from updated Section 45L Tax Credits tied to ENERGY STAR program requirements, while commercial building owners can claim deductions for energy efficiency improvements. Aspects of Home Electrification #1. Switch from Gas-Based to Electric Stove Gas stoves release pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) into the indoor environment, which can have negative impacts on human health. Electric stoves do not emit these pollutants, providing a cleaner and healthier indoor environment. If we talk about climate concerns, Electric stoves produce no direct greenhouse gas emissions, as they do not burn any fossil fuels during operation. Meanwhile, gas stoves emit carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) during combustion. If the electricity used by the electric stove comes from renewable sources, its greenhouse gas emissions will be significantly lower than those of a gas stove. Efficiency is another aspect where electric stoves have the upper hand over gas stoves. Where a gas stove uses three units of energy to boil a quart of water, an induction stove needs just one. by The Environmental Protection Agency, if every stove sold in 2021 were an induction stove, the world would save electricity worth $125 million. #2. Replace your Furnace with Heat Pump Heat pumps are significantly more energy-efficient compared to oil and gas furnaces. While furnaces generate heat by burning fuel, heat pumps transfer heat from one place to another. An air-source heat pump can provide up to , meaning it can deliver three units of heat for every unit of electricity consumed. A traditional gas or oil furnace has an efficiency ranging from 80-95%, which means some energy is lost as waste heat during combustion. Since heat pumps run on electricity, their greenhouse gas emissions are directly related to the carbon intensity of the grid. As the grid becomes greener with increased renewable energy generation, the emissions associated with heat pump operation decrease. In contrast, burning fossil fuels in oil or gas furnaces directly releases CO 2 and other greenhouse gases, contributing to climate change. #3. Switch to Induction and Electric Cooktops and Ovens Replace gas stoves and ovens with electric or induction cooktops and electric ovens. Induction cooktops are particularly energy-efficient and provide precise temperature control. Many of you might be fond of cooking and think that gas flames are more responsive and precise when compared with electric burners. But that’s not right! Induction cooktops warm up and cool faster than gas cookers and offer highly accurate temperature control. Magnetic inductions cook food by generating a magnetic field under the pot and eliminate the need for a burner altogether, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The World Needs to Shift from Fossil Fuel to Renewable Energy Sources to Produce More Clean Electricity FAST As the demand for electricity increases due to the widespread adoption of electric appliances and vehicles, it becomes even more critical to ensure that the electricity consumed is generated from renewable sources rather than simply shifting the burden of gas consumption from one place to another. Integrating increased renewable electricity production into the grid is the key to successful electrification. This involves a combination of strategies: Expanding renewable energy capacity: Developing more solar and wind farms, as well as other renewable energy sources such as hydroelectric, geothermal, and biomass. Grid modernization and flexibility: Upgrading the grid infrastructure to accommodate variable renewable energy sources is crucial. Decentralized energy generation: Encouraging the adoption of distributed renewable energy generation, such as rooftop solar panels and small-scale wind turbines. Supportive policies and regulations: Governments play a vital role in promoting electrification coupled with increased renewable energy production Steps Taken By Big Companies to Transform Homes into Virtual Power Plants One of the more prominent arguments for home electrification is that homes can act as virtual power plants, not for electricity products, but for controlling electricity consumption. It's possible you think of this term as electricity production, but they call large swaths of smart-connected homes power plants because, with the flip of a switch, a utility company can lower the temperature of a house and reduce electricity consumption (lowering the heat in winter or AC in summer) in a big way to avoid turning on a literal power plant. Logical Buildings and Keyframe Capital Launch $110M Plan to Turn NYC Apartments into Virtual Power Plants Logical Buildings and Keyframe Capital have announced a $110 million financing plan to install and operate smart thermostats in thousands of New York and New Jersey rental units, transforming apartments into virtual power plants (VPPs). The plan aims to help multifamily buildings save energy and reduce CO 2 emissions while addressing the ""split incentive"" challenge between building owners and tenants. The smart thermostats will be connected to Logical Buildings' VPP platform, which controls temperature settings in real-time to reduce energy demand. The first $25 million tranche of investments aims to enable about 100 megawatts of peak load-reduction capacity across several multifamily buildings. Sunnova in Talks for $3.3B DOE Loan Guarantee to Expand Virtual Power Plants for Low-Income Households Residential solar provider Sunnova is in discussions with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to secure a loan guarantee covering 90% of up to $3.3 billion for solar loans. The guarantee could help expand Sunnova's ""Energy as a Service"" offerings, enabling low-income customers to access rooftop solar, backup batteries, and other modern virtual power plant (VPP) tools. The initiative aligns with the Biden administration's goals to combat climate change and provide clean energy benefits to disadvantaged communities. 4 Major Home Electrification Companies Startups Within Home Electrification #1.

Warming Up to Climate Tech,Climate Tech Grants Guide for Startups and Investors,Learn about how climate tech startups attract grant funding and the importance of grant funding to de-risk climate tech ventures for VCs and angelÉ,"Grants are a critical form of funding for innovation, enabling new initiatives and technologies to be developed. This guide will walk you through why grants attract startups and investors, how the current grant space is now compared to the past, and the best places to find grants. Thanks for reading Warming Up to Climate Tech! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. Subscribe Grants and Other Equity-Free Incentives Attract Climate Tech Startups and VCs Reason #1. Lower Financial Risk for Founders Launching a startup is expensive as you need funds for research, development, patents, prototyping, and other aspects which can be far more expensive than a SaaS startup. Grants and equity-free incentives help offset these higher upfront costs, allowing founders to focus on developing their technologies without the burden of further dilution of ownership or personally guaranteed debt. This reduces the financial risk associated with launching a climate tech startup, making it more attractive for entrepreneurs to enter the field and VCs to invest in it. Reason #2. Accelerated Innovation Grants and other equity-free incentives act as catalysts for innovation, providing much-needed financial support to startups that are working on breakthrough technologies. These incentives in climate tech enable startups to expedite their development cycles and bring their tech to market faster, increasing the overall pace of innovation within the climate tech ecosystem. Reason #3. Recruiting Top Talent With equity-free incentives, startups can dedicate more resources to hiring top talent, building strong teams, and fostering a culture of innovation. This contributes to the success of individual startups and strengthens the entire climate tech ecosystem, as these talented individuals drive the development of cutting-edge solutions to address climate change. Reasons #4. Encouraging Investors VCs are attracted to investing in climate tech startups that have acquired grants or other equity-free incentives. That’s because grants and equity-free incentives signal that a startup has undergone a rigorous selection procedure and has financial support from other sources. This validation and resource allocation can attract additional investment, as it reduces the risk associated with backing early-stage climate tech ventures. How Does the Current Grant Space Compare to 2006-2011 Cleantech Boom and Bust The climate tech space has evolved significantly since the 2006-2011 cleantech boom and bust. It’s important to see how the market has changed to make sure that the same bust does not happen this time around. #1. Market Readiness and Maturity During the 2006-2011 cleantech boom, many climate tech companies struggled to achieve commercial viability. The reason being, after 2008’s peak investment, shifted towards late-stage rounds, making it challenging for the early-stage startups to get their product to market. In contrast, the current climate tech boom is characterized by more mature technologies, which are better positioned to deliver on their promises and VCs have readily invested in them. The US government has also created many grants and equity-free incentives to help climate tech startups reverse climate change. Now, climate tech startups have both more mature technologies to bring to market and more development funding available to ensure companies have enough resources to develop and scale without going bankrupt. #2. Policy Support and Government Commitment The 2008 cleantech boom witnessed inconsistent policy support, with governments often wavering in their commitment to clean energy. Today, there is a global consensus on the urgency of addressing climate change. This has led to more robust policy measures, international climate agreements, and more consistent government support for climate tech initiatives. The is the first large chunk of monetary support for climate-friendly manufacturing and purchasing in the US, but many smaller bills and policy changes add up to make a big difference as well. As I’m writing this, the EPA is planning to implement strict auto pollution limits which will help transition us to electric vehicles. This kind of policy creates more involuntary market movements toward EVs, which benefits both large and small players in the electric vehicle market. #3. Public Awareness and Engagement From 2006-2011, climate tech companies found it a challenge to spread public awareness about the environmental crisis or grow startups. The Venture capital (VC) firms spent over $25 billion funding clean energy technology (cleantech) startups from 2006 to 2011 and lost over half their money; as a result, funding has dried up in the cleantech sector. This led to underperforming investments with the exception of 2010. In 2010, the cleantech companies delivered handsome returns - an internal rate of return (IRR) of 45% - because of the sale of Nest to Google. #4. Financial Landscape During the 2006-2011 cleantech boom, there was a rush of investment without proper due diligence, resulting in overvaluation and eventual collapse of many companies. In the current climate tech boom, investors have learned from past mistakes and are more cautious and strategic in their approach. #5. Collaboration and Partnerships The current climate tech boom is characterized by increased collaboration between public and private sectors, as well as between for-profit companies and research institutions. These partnerships have fostered the exchange of knowledge and resources, accelerating the development and deployment of climate tech solutions. Best Sources for Finding Grants #1.

Warming Up to Climate Tech,The True Efficacy of Carbon Removal Technology,"Carbon capture technology has recently become very popular, but there are valid questions about its ability to make a meaningful impact on the climateÉ","With dire forecasts of temperature rises, governments, scientists, and climate advocates are serious about how we could engineer solutions to bring us back from the point of no return. Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technology is one of these categories of solutions that can help mitigate climate change by reducing the overall concentration of CO 2 in the atmosphere to help us limit the effects of climate change. Thanks for reading Warming Up to Climate Tech! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. Subscribe What is Carbon Removal? Carbon removal is a process that involves capturing carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere and then either reusing, storing, or disposing of it safely. There are three main stages in the carbon capture process: Capture: CO 2 emissions are separated from other gases produced during the combustion of fossil fuels or other industrial processes. There are several methods for capturing CO 2 , such as pre-combustion capture, post-combustion capture, and oxyfuel combustion. These methods use various technologies, including absorption, adsorption, membranes, and cryogenics, to separate carbon dioxide from other gases. Transport: Once the CO 2 has been captured, it needs to be transported to a storage site. This can be done using pipelines, ships, or trucks, depending on the distance and the amount of the gas to be transported. In most cases, pipelines are the preferred method due to their efficiency and lower environmental impact. Storage: The final step in the CCS process is storing the captured CO 2 , usually in geological formations deep underground. These formations can include depleted oil and gas reservoirs, saline aquifers, and unmineable coal seams. The CO 2 is injected into these formations, where it can be trapped and stored safely for thousands of years. Carbon capture is considered an essential climate mitigation technology as it can remove CO 2 emissions from the atmosphere. It can also be used in combination with other technologies, like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), which can result in net-negative emissions by removing CO 2 from the atmosphere. However, there are challenges to be addressed, such as high costs, scalability, and public acceptance to fully realize the potential of carbon capture and storage. Types of Carbon Removal Methods #1. Natural Methods Afforestation and Reforestation Planting trees is a nature-based solution to carbon removal. Through the process of photosynthesis, trees absorb CO 2 from the atmosphere and store it in their biomass (trunks, branches, leaves, and roots) and in the soil. Afforestation involves planting trees on previously non-forested land, while reforestation refers to replanting trees in areas where forests have been depleted. These methods not only help sequester carbon but also provide numerous co-benefits, such as preserving biodiversity, improving water quality, and supporting local economies. Soil Carbon Sequestration Soil is a major carbon reservoir, containing more carbon than the atmosphere and vegetation combined. Soil carbon sequestration involves enhancing the soil's capacity to store carbon through practices like regenerative agriculture, no-till farming, cover cropping, and compost application. By improving soil health, these practices can increase the amount of organic matter in the soil, which in turn boosts the soil's ability to store carbon. Other Natural Methods There are multiple other less popular but still effective natural processes that help remove carbon from the atmosphere: Wetland Restoration: Wetlands, like marshes and peatlands, are carbon sinks that can store significant amounts of CO 2 . Restoring and protecting these ecosystems helps sequester carbon. Ocean Fertilization: This approach involves adding nutrients, such as iron, to the ocean to stimulate the growth of phytoplankton. These microscopic plants absorb CO 2 as they grow and, when they die, can sink to the ocean floor, effectively sequestering carbon. Coastal Ecosystems Management: Coastal ecosystems, such as mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes, are efficient carbon sinks. Preserving and restoring these ecosystems can help remove CO 2 from the atmosphere. Grazing management: Adjusting grazing practices, such as rotational grazing, can improve soil health and increase carbon storage in grasslands. Biochar: Biochar is a type of charcoal produced by burning organic matter in a low-oxygen environment. When applied to soils, it can help retain water and nutrients while increasing carbon storage. #2. Technology Methods Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) CCS involves capturing CO 2 emissions from large point sources like power plants and industrial facilities and then transporting and storing the gas in geological formations. This technology has the potential to significantly reduce CO 2 emissions from some of the largest sources, making it a potentially crucial component of climate change mitigation strategies. Direct Air Capture (DAC) DAC is an emerging technology that extracts CO 2 directly from the ambient air. This process uses chemical processes, typically involving sorbents, to selectively bind CO 2 from the air, followed by a regeneration step that releases the captured CO 2 for storage or utilization. DAC systems can be deployed anywhere and are not limited to point sources, making them a versatile carbon removal option. However, it’s currently energy-intensive and expensive, so ongoing research and development are needed to improve its efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Enhanced Weathering This process accelerates the natural weathering of minerals to remove CO 2 from the atmosphere. When certain minerals, such as olivine and basalt, interact with CO 2 and water, they undergo chemical reactions that convert carbon dioxide into stable carbonate minerals. By grinding these minerals into fine particles and spreading them on land or in oceans, the rate of weathering can be increased, leading to more efficient CO 2 removal. Enhanced weathering has the potential to store large amounts of CO 2 , but it is still a developing technology and more research is needed to determine its scalability, environmental impacts, and long-term storage potential. Why Is Carbon Removal Necessary? Addressing the Urgency of Climate Change The increase in greenhouse gas emissions, primarily carbon dioxide, has led to a rapid rise in global temperatures and consequent climate change impacts, such as more frequent and severe weather events, rising sea levels, and loss of biodiversity. To mitigate these impacts and limit global warming to 1.5°C or well below 2°C, as stated in the Paris Agreement, we need to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and actively remove CO 2 from the atmosphere. Along with the attempts to promote renewable energy sources usage, enhance energy efficiencies, and adopt sustainable land-use practices, carbon removal tech gives us the possibility of getting to net zero without the need to invest heavily in lowering hard-to-abate emissions. Co-Benefits of Carbon Removal In addition to addressing climate change, many carbon removal methods offer a range of co-benefits. For instance, nature-based solutions like afforestation, reforestation, and soil carbon sequestration can improve soil health, increase crop yield, enhance water quality, and protect and restore ecosystems, leading to increased biodiversity. These solutions can also create new economic opportunities and support local communities through job creation and sustainable resource management. Technological carbon removal methods, such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) or direct air capture (DAC), can stimulate innovation, create new industries, and provide opportunities for collaboration between the public and private sectors. The True Potential of Carbon Removal #1. Afforestation or Reforestation Can Remove Significant Amounts of Carbon from the Atmosphere Afforestation and reforestation could remove between metric gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year by 2050. To put this into context, in 2022, global greenhouse gas emissions were around . Achieving the upper end of the estimate (10.1 GtCO 2 e) would represent a substantial contribution to net emissions reduction. However, even the lower end of the estimate (0.5 GtCO 2 e) would still make a meaningful impact, especially when combined with other mitigation strategies. How much carbon removal can be done via afforestation or reforestation depends on factors like the availability of land, the type of tree species planted, the pace of tree growth, management practices, and potential changes in policies and societal behavior. It’s difficult to predict with certainty whether we will achieve the upper or lower end of this range by 2050, but the level of success will largely depend on the collective efforts of governments, businesses, and individuals in addressing the factors outlined above. #2. Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage Facilities Capture Almost 45 Mt CO 2 Annually Currently, about 35 industrial facilities are utilizing carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technologies in various sectors, including industrial processes, fuel conversion, and power generation. These facilities have a combined annual capture capacity of nearly of CO 2 . Despite previously lagging behind expectations, CCUS deployment has gained significant momentum in recent years, with approximately 300 projects at different stages of development throughout the CCUS value chain. Startups Are Coming Up with Innovative Carbon Capture Methods #1. Climeworks Uses Direct Carbon Capture uses a three-step direct air capture process to capture CO 2 : Step 1: A fan situated within the collector draws in ambient air. As the air flows through an internal filter, the carbon dioxide particles are trapped. Step 2: Once the filter reaches its maximum capacity for CO₂, the collector shuts, and the temperature inside rises to approximately 100°C, about the same temperature as boiling water. Step 3: At this elevated temperature, the filter releases the captured CO₂, which can then be stored. The company has already launched its first large-scale carbon capture plant in Iceland called Orca, which helps them capture thousands of tons of CO 2 . Their ultimate goal is to capture Gigatons of carbon dioxide and achieve climate impact at scale till 2050. Climeworks is one of the leading carbon capture tech companies in the world, but it is unclear what their impact to date has been. They have not publicized how much carbon they have removed from the atmosphere, but their newest facility will have a nominal capacity of just 36,000 tons removed per year. #2. Carbominer Uses Novel Modular Direct Air Capture Technology with Electrochemistry Regeneration is a Ukranian hardware startup that has developed a new modular Direct Air Capture technology designed for local CO 2 capture near places of use. Carbominer's capture efficiency is based on a number of innovative engineering solutions. Key competitive advantages of Carbominer include the mobility of their capture modules and the inherent capacity to utilize intermittent renewable energy sources effectively. #3. Barton Blakeley Uses Rocket Technology to Burn Carbon Dioxide carbon capture system, HYPER XI converts carbon dioxide into valuable products with a process that requires no heat or electrical input. Through this method, carbon emissions, instead of being the problem, become part of fueling the solution to climate change. They have designed, developed, and patented an advanced emission recovery system that's based on the principles of aerospace engineering and advanced material science. #4. Novocarbo Builds Biochar Products to Reduce Carbon Emissions is at the forefront of the biochar industry. Over recent years, they have grown to become one of the largest distribution networks and trading platforms for biochar and its derivatives in Europe. Their carbon-neutral material is utilized across various applications, including industrial feedstocks, agriculture, water treatment, and decarbonizing construction materials. Collaborating with global corporations and research institutions, the company is dedicated to discovering new applications and expanding the use of biochar. #5. CarbonSpace Uses Satellite-Powered Platform for Carbon Capture is a SaaS for estimating carbon footprint from land use.

Major deals included Climeworks' $634.4 million series F round and Carbon Clean's $150 million series C raise. The sudden rise in investment is because VCs understand that carbon removal is essential for a net-zero world, particularly in industries like aviation and cement production. Regulatory changes, such as , have made carbon capture more appealing by increasing tax credits and lowering eligibility thresholds. VC Fund Counteract Raises $18 Million for Carbon Removal , a London-based venture capital fund focused on carbon removal technologies, has reached a first close of £15 million (~$18 million) out of its targeted £35 million ($42 million) inaugural fund. The fund invests in companies with the potential to remove 500 million tonnes of CO 2 by 2050. Counteract's portfolio already includes 12 companies working on various carbon removal techniques. The team plans to expand their investments beyond Europe and explore solutions with additional benefits, such as cement production from recycled carbon. Invest to Find Breakthroughs in Technology Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) holds considerable promise in the global pursuit of net-zero emissions by 2050. However, it is crucial to maintain a balanced and skeptical perspective when evaluating the feasibility of CCS as a primary solution. The high costs associated with developing and deploying CCS technology may present significant challenges. Public investment is likely required to offset risks to venture capitalists and spur widespread adoption of CCS. There are still concerns about the long-term storage, regulatory frameworks, and potential unintended consequences of the technology. In light of these concerns, it is essential for governments, corporations, and investors to consider a diversified approach to climate solutions. This would involve investing in CCS research and innovation while also prioritizing other sustainable technologies and practices. By pursuing a multifaceted strategy, we can work towards a more sustainable future that accounts for the potential risks and rewards of carbon capture and sequestration.

Warming Up to Climate Tech,Greenlist Decarbonizes Online Retail Returns,"Interview with Jess Owens, the founder of Greenlist - a software powering peer-to-peer returns for retailers and their customers. Greenlist reduces theÉ","Greenlist powers peer-to-peer returns for retailers, decarbonizing online returns while saving retailers money and enabling customers to access out-of-stock inventory. After going through New York Fashion Tech Lab’s program, the Greenlist team is working to grow its client base of online retailers. I spoke with Founder & CEO, Jess Owens, about her founding journey, mission-first approach, and growth plans for the rest of 2023. Thanks for reading Warming Up to Climate Tech! Subscribe for free to receive new posts every month. Subscribe Jacob Sheldon: Can you introduce yourself and your company? Jess Owens: I'm located in Falls Church, Virginia, right outside of DC, and the name of my company is Greenlist. Greenlist is a technology that enables peer-to-peer returns. Right now, when you return something you bought online, for instance, a jacket or a pair of shoes, that merchandise travels back to a warehouse, a store, or a trash can. With Greenlist, that return instead goes directly to another consumer. We're calling this peer-to-peer returns, and we quite simply are cutting out the middle steps and sending it directly from one house to another house. Jacob: That's a really cool idea. How did you come up with it? Jess: It's from a personal problem I had while shopping online, and a jacket sold out of my shopping cart. I was totally obsessed with this jacket and had to have it. I reached out to the store, and asked, “Can you connect me to a return of this jacket?” I knew 30 to 40% of those jackets would get returned to the store. They couldn't do this. In fact, no store is able to connect shoppers to returns. I thought, why can't we do that? That's nuts. I quit my job and set out to solve my own problem. I built a small team of advisers around me, and I got to work. One thing that I quickly realized through a lot of research on the industry is that returns are incredibly pollutive. They travel back and forth across the country. They pile up in warehouses. They're shipped abroad, they're trashed. As I continued to think about the problem I had, I thought the most sustainable approach to solving this is to send that jacket directly from your house to my house because it doesn't fit you or you don't like it, but I want it, and I'm waiting on it. That's how we came to the solution. Jacob: It seems like a no-brainer kind of solution. Why don't the companies do this on their own? Jess: Well, there are a few reasons. E-commerce returns have been processed one way for the past 20 years, so it's a really big leap to change something you've always done in a certain way. That is part of the pushback we've gotten from companies; it’s a totally new concept. As well, a little bit of the pushback we've gotten from investors is because they often want to see something that's already working in the market. Since we’re the first in the market to do this, it’s definitely more challenging. Jacob: Could you tell me about the problems you're solving for companies? Jess: Retail returns are very expensive to retailers. In fact, last year, they cost companies over $800 billion and shipping costs also continue to rise up to 10% annually. Warehouse fulfillment costs are on the rise as well. All of the retailers’ expenses are increasing substantially, and on the other side, over 6 billion pounds of returns go to landfills every year. Retail returns are bad for the bottom line, and they're bad for the planet. Jacob: Can you explain how your solution is solving these two problems? Jess: Because of our peer-to-peer model, we're cutting out at least one leg of the shipment. That immediately reduces the cost significantly and is one of our biggest selling points. As I also mentioned, many returns go directly to landfill - up to 50% is what some people estimate. By reducing the number of returns that go back to the retailer, we are cutting back on the number that go to landfills. We're also reducing carbon emissions and cutting packaging waste in half because we ask users to reuse their packaging. Jacob: For you, personally, do you vibe more with the climate problem or the cost issue? Jess: Definitely more on the climate side. When I started the business, jumping into something like this was hugely risky. I have always been very concerned about our planet and, as a mom, I worry about my children’s futures. . We do things in our home like compost and save water, anything we can to minimize the impact that we're making as a family. I thought, if I could work towards something that makes even a small difference for our planet, then my life's work would be meaningful. That really resonated with me from day one, and quite frankly, it’s what has kept us going through all the very hard times. Jacob: I'm sure it's at least a little bit easier to have the retailers calculate their cost savings from using Greenlist, but how do you or your customers quantify your impact on the climate? Jess: In this early stage we are focused on verifiable improvements that our model makes in the traditional return and resale process. We're able to calculate the number of miles that our process reduces and the items travel, which we use as a barometer for our emissions. We've also used Flexport's carbon emission calculator to approximate the emission savings, and we say there's about one pound of CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent) reduced per package. The packaging waste as well is cut directly in half. In the future, we hope to do a full LCA because we’re still approximating our numbers at this point. Jacob: How many retail partners do you have? Jess: We have one big partner on board, and then we have five other very small retail companies, and those are all apparel, but we also have one furniture pilot running in the Bay Area. Furniture is a completely different beast, but it's been lucrative, and the waste that it's cutting down on is significant as well. Jacob: Can you describe your target customer’s profile? Jess: Our target shoppers include Gen Z and Millennials. They are already shopping peer-to-peer companies like Poshmark and Facebook groups so they are very familiar with this concept. On the retailer side, we are focused on shoe, apparel and furniture clients. Ideally, companies that get a lot of new-with-tags returns. Jacob: How large is the market? Jess: Returns grew from $760 billion in 2021 to $816 billion in 2022. It will be a trillion-dollar problem in the near future. Online shopping has increased more than 95% in the past five years, so clearly, the numbers are skyrocketing. Plus, COVID didn't help. People stopped going into stores and started primarily shopping online which has encouraged behaviors like bracketing - ordering two sizes of the same item with plans to return the one that doesn’t fit. Jacob: What are you doing to expand? What’s working and what's not? Jess: Last year, we participated in a program called New York Fashion Tech Lab, and it was a phenomenal opportunity. It’s run by about 10 massive retail partners such as Macy's, Calvin Klein, and Kate Spade. They picked five founders working on problems that they're interested in. Being selected for the program was a huge honor, and it put us in front of the biggest companies in the world. We spent three months with those groups and walked away with strong relationships and a lot of feedback on how we could best serve enterprise clients. It opened a lot of doors for us in the industry. Beyond that, we are trying all the traditional marketing channels such as paid ads, LinkedIn conversations, newsletters, content networking, events and strategic PR. Our most effective tool, however, has been our constant outreach and networking with industry experts. This has really helped us build our pipeline. Jacob: What is your sales process to retailers like? Jess: We start with questions to help us understand how the company currently handles returns, how big of a pain point this is for them and if they are motivated to try new solutions. We then describe, at a high level, what greenlist is. We show them our customer journey map and then we demonstrate the product working on Vestique, the large customer that we are partnered with. We take questions and ask if greenlist is a solution they would try. We end the call asking who we should meet with next. Because our solution touches many different departments, we have to get buy-in from the following teams: logistics, marketing, sustainability, e-commerce and finance. The sales cycle for a tech technology is a long and arduous process. Jacob: How easy is it for retailers to implement Greenlist? Jess: Our solution is a customized Shopify app so we are currently focused on Shopify users. Onboarding new clients is easy - our engineers complete the integration and are finished in under a week, with no work needed by the retailer. We are also in conversations with companies who use other e-commerce platforms such as Salesforce. A Salesforce integration would be more work on our end but our goal is to make this as easy as possible for everyone we partner with. Jacob: Let's say I'm a customer on the receiving end of a peer-to-peer return. What happens if the product is damaged or poorly packed? How do you protect against this happening? Jess: Greenlist transacts new-with-tags returns only. During the return process, the ""returning customer"" has to qualify that the item is unworn and in perfect condition. If the end customer receives the item and it is not as it was described, they reach out to us, and we handle it on a case-by-case basis. We have a customer-centric approach and approve refunds as needed. Fortunately, we haven't had any issues with quality control yet. We attribute this to our communication throughout the process and our focus on Gen Z and Millennial shoppers who are already well-trained in the peer-to-peer model. Jacob: What did you do before Greenlist? Jess: I worked in marketing and business consulting. I helped many different entrepreneurs across a variety of industries. My work ranged from helping companies build their identities and launch their businesses to fixing internal problems and scaling to new markets. My goal was to do a deep dive and really understand the business and then create an actionable plan to help them thrive. Jacob: Did you already have some of the customer connections for Greenlist from your career? Jess: I actually didn't, which has been another challenge. I jumped from consulting into building technology for the retail industry. Despite this, I’m very proud of the network I’ve built - we’ve spoken with many of the largest apparel companies in our country. Jacob: As well I imagine product development was outside of your wheelhouse when you started Greenlist. How did you go about filling that gap? Jess: It was! One of my first steps was to build a group of advisors around me who worked in retail, technology and sustainability. These advisors helped me fill in gaps that I needed to understand to build a successful product. One of my earliest teammates, Eric, worked in corporate retail for over 15 years. The two of us partnered closely to develop the first iteration of greenlist. Jacob: What would you say is one thing you do really well as a company? Jess: I'm very proud of effectively introducing a new concept to the industry. A woman from Germany contacted me recently because she heard of us during Berlin Fashion Week. We’ve gotten a lotof interest from the press, and that started even before we were launched. People are excited about our mission and want to see us succeed. Jacob: What’s one thing that you've struggled with as a company? Jess: I've struggled with raising money. Female founders get less than 2% of venture funding, and that's been a really hard barrier for me to break through. That has also affected my confidence as a founder. There are VCs that have pursued us, and then we hear no, over and over again. I know that's a very common story for entrepreneurs, but it's still really hard to deal with. Jacob: What have you done to try and get around that? Jess: I'm focused on sales and just getting as far as we can with the funding that we do have. We raised a great round from friends, family, angels, and a small angel group. We have been successful enough to get us to our next milestones. My goal is that we can go back to those VCs that turned us down and restart the conversations after we make more progress. Jacob: What's one piece of advice you have for other entrepreneurs? Jess: Build a community of other founders around you. That has been hugely valuable for me. You can do this through an accelerator or other networking opportunities, but it’s vital that you do because nobody understands the journey you're going through quite like other founders. It’s impossible to explain the intense highs and lows that entrepreneurs experience. The founders I’ve met have been incredibly supportive throughout this process . Jacob: What would you say is your biggest blocker right now? Jess: We need more retail partners on board. Because we're a completely new concept and because retail is a risk-averse bunch it's been hard for us to quickly onboard a lot of companies. We’re hoping that 2023 will be a big year for us because we've seen really good results from our early partners in 2022. The returns that we transact are 50% more profitable and travel about 52% less miles. We are ticking both of the boxes and making companies more profitable and more sustainable at the same time. We need to show this to other retailers in a meaningful way that will drive them to take the next steps. Jacob: What's your long-term goal for the company? Jess: We want to change the way that people and retailers think about returns. Most returns are in sellable shape before they reach the warehouse dock and we want retailers to take advantage of this. The moment that someone starts to make a return, we need to have more efficient processes and systems that handle the return. By enabling the peer-to-peer model, we're doing exactly that and allowing stores to capture more profit and be more environmentally friendly. Jacob: Who is on your team and why? Jess: My co-founder is Ashley White. She is a front-end developer and a UX/UI expert. The two of us have worked together for over eight years. She was the first person I called when I had this idea. Ashley started researching the feasibility of what I was envisioning and her technical background allowed her to instantly make an impact. Ashley is responsible for all of our branding and design assets and she also oversees our developers. The third member of our team is Zack Whitacre and he is my Chief of Staff and Head of Operations. Zack is a jack of all trades. He worked on the finance, operations and sustainability teams at Bonobos for more than 8 years. . Zack’s retail background is so valuable to the company. I also have a few consultants helping us with marketing and our go-to-market strategy. I can't fail to mention my wonderful board of advisors who have helped us with everything from starting the business to connecting us with people and helping us understand the market and how to move forward. Jacob: So it's very clear that you care a lot about the climate. How do you personally feel the effects of climate change in your life? Jess: The weather has been one thing that is very clearly changing as the planet warms up. The intensity of storms have increased and communities are devastated by forest fires, floods and droughts. Our reliance on fossil fuels and modern conveniences have built unsustainable habits across the globe and we have less than 10 years to turn things around. We have to make drastic changes, adopt new models and all work together to improve our planet’s health. Learn more about Greenlist’s for retailers.

Warming Up to Climate Tech,Ai to Combat Climate Change,"There are countless opportunities for artificial intelligence to optimize the way we live, work, allocate resources, and more to fight climate changeÉ","New applications of Ai are helping startups and corporations fight climate change through optimizations and better decision-making. Ai has the ability to analyze huge datasets and find patterns humans can't, which creates countless opportunities to optimize the way we live, work, allocate resources, and more. How Ai-Built Applications Can Help Combat Climate Change Ai can help tackle a wide range of challenges, from predicting and mitigating the impacts of extreme weather events to optimizing energy usage and reducing waste. With Ai, climate tech startups can gather and analyze complex datasets on carbon emissions, energy prices, consumer behavior, and more. This can be used to make informed decisions to combat carbon emissions and build a greener society. Thanks for reading Warming Up to Climate Tech! Subscribe for free to receive new posts every month. Subscribe Keeping this in mind, (BCG) recently surveyed public and private companies that are fighting climate change with Ai and came up with some encouraging insights: 87% of climate and Ai leaders find Ai to be helpful in fighting climate change 43% of climate tech leaders want to integrate Ai into their current technology More than half of the US leaders have the vision of using Ai to fight climate change 78% of the leaders cite there’s insufficient access to Ai in the organization 67% of private sector leaders feel that government should do more to support and enhance Ai technology Public and private sector leaders think reducing carbon emissions is where Ai-enabled climate technology will be of the most use Based on this survey, BCG created a framework that explains how Ai can be a part of climate tech in diverse ways: The framework has three major parts - Mitigation, Adaptation and resilience, and Fundamentals. #1. Mitigation Mitigation encompasses the actions taken to reduce or prevent greenhouse gas emissions and limit the negative effects of climate change. These actions can include: Implementing clean energy technologies Increasing energy efficiency Adopting low-carbon transportation options Promoting sustainable land use practices #2. Adaptation and Resilience Adaptation is the process of adjusting to the expected future climate to reduce vulnerability and increase resilience. It involves identifying specific impacts of climate change in different sectors and taking actions to minimize risks and enhance opportunities. Resilience refers to the ability of a system to bounce back from a disturbance, such as a large-scale weather event. Resilience strategies focus on building the capacity of individuals, communities, and systems to anticipate and prepare for changing conditions. #3. Fundamentals Artificial intelligence (Ai) has the potential to support various aspects of climate change mitigation and adaptation. For example, Ai can be used to enhance: Climate research and modeling: Modeling of economic and social transition Facilitate climate finance: Forecasting carbon prices Educating, nudging, and behavioral changes: Recommendations for climate-friendly consumption Ai Has Opened Doors to Multiple Opportunities in Climate Tech One of the biggest advantages of Ai is its ability to analyze large sets of data and come up with solutions. Data analysis is a key aspect for many companies working in climate tech. Here’s how Ai can help: Monitoring and predicting climate patterns and impacts: Analyze a large amount of data, identify patterns, and make more accurate predictions about future climate impacts. Energy management and optimization: Ai can analyze real-time data on energy consumption and production for a company and suggest a course of action to optimize energy management. Sustainable agriculture and forestry: Improve the efficiency and sustainability of agriculture by analyzing soil and weather data, optimizing irrigation and fertilizer use, and predicting crop yields. Transportation and urban planning: Optimize traffic flow in urban areas, which can reduce congestion and energy consumption ( already does this to some extent). Ai can also analyze traffic data, provide personalized routing recommendations, and reduce fuel consumption and emissions. Disaster response and risk management: Study weather patterns and provide advanced warnings that can alert people in the area about the potential threat. During my research, I came across some startups that are embedding Ai with their current climate tech product. Startups Have Already Come Up with Innovative Ai Tech to Fight Climate Change #1. Paces - Accelerating Green Infrastructure Project Development gathers data to help green infrastructure developers decide where to develop their projects, giving them a higher chance of success from the beginning. “80% of the 1,269 clean energy projects developers start never actually get built because most projects are started without deep due diligence on zoning and interconnection due to the cost of collecting that data. This means $51B worth of canceled projects over the next 3 years.” - James McWalter, CEO. Ai will allow Paces to provide the best recommendations to their customers, effectively increasing the amount of renewable . It’s important to increase the amount of renewable energy on the grid to lower fossil fuel usage for generating electricity and protecting our environment from climate change. The global renewable energy market was valued at , and is projected to reach $1.9 trillion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 8.4% from 2021 to 2030. #2. Sipremo - Natural Disaster and Climate Change Forecasting is analyzes data and forecasts the possibility of natural disasters or climate change in an area. They have a four-step process that helps predict changes. Step 1: Artificial Intelligence: Enables businesses to predict and mitigate the impact of climate events through proactive and assertive decision-making. Step 2: Contextualization: The ​​framework considers climate change variables to generate operational insights that enhance resilience, reduce damage and loss, and mitigate the impact of climate events on businesses. Step 3: Innovation and Adoption: Come up with a climate adaptation strategy based on the risks and impacts it might have. Step 4: Resilience and Proactivity: Contribute to cost and bureaucracy reduction, response time reduction, and operational activity optimization. #3. Avalo - Accelerated Adaptation of Crops to Climate Change , food production needs to increase by at least 60% to feed our growing global population by 2050. And Avalo is en route to make it happen. Ai-based platform streamlines the costly and time-consuming aspects of crop development while identifying the biological origin of traits essential to the future of agriculture. They help crops adapt to climate change in four ways: Discover biological traits that make plants resilient to climate change Create new plant strains that are better tasting and healthier Help increase diversity by creating plants tailored to different environmental conditions worldwide Offer bioinformatics services for crop analysis #4. Pano - Actionable Intelligence for Wildfire Management During wildfires, a significant amount of carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere as trees and other vegetation burn. This leads to an increase in carbon emissions and raises the temperature of the Earth’s surface. uses Ai to predict and communicate wildfire threats to fire professionals, companies, and even homeowners who live near forests. #5. BrainBox Ai - Making Buildings Smarter, Greener, and More Efficient has built an Ai-powered HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) brain that makes buildings energy efficient. According to BrainBox, HVAC systems are responsible for almost 50% of buildings' energy consumption, of which 35% is usually wasted. So to reduce energy waste, they have come up with a product that connects with the building's HVAC system in three hours and starts analyzing data. It takes two to four months for Brainbox's Ai platform to learn a building's thermal behavior. Once it has analyzed the building's HVAC system, it then feeds external information, such as weather forecasts and energy prices to the Ai and does future forecasting for each zone in a building. By utilizing predictions, the Ai technology identifies optimization strategies and independently sends commands to each price of HVAC equipment, ensuring the most comfortable temperatures for occupants while minimizing energy consumption. How Large Corporations are Using Ai For The Climate Microsoft’s Efforts to Leverage Ai to Fight Climate Change Microsoft is using Ai to fight climate change by expanding its Ai for Earth program, which aims to ""monitor, model, and manage the Earth's natural systems."" This program uses Ai to collect and analyze data about energy consumption and weather patterns to help conserve power, reduce needless water usage in agriculture, and better manage natural resources. The expansion of the program will take place in three steps: Awarding researchers with seed grants for designing and testing new Ai applications. Identifying the most promising applications and scaling them up with larger investments. Incorporating the most useful applications into services provided to climate scientists and those involved with sustainable initiatives. The ultimate goal of Microsoft's Ai for Earth program is to democratize Ai and make it accessible to both scientists and business owners so that they can utilize the technology to analyze climate data and provide information to help take strategic action toward fighting climate change. Energy Usage Concerns: The Downside of Ai Ai has surely opened numerous doors to help fight climate change, but the only downside it seems to have is energy consumption. published by the University of Massachusetts, training a single Ai model can emit as much carbon as five cars would emit in their lifetimes. And this is just for training a single model. When you use this Ai model repeatedly, the net energy consumption increases dramatically. Why Does Ai Consume So Much Energy? Ai requires millions to billions of training examples so that it can learn how to work. For example, if you want an Ai to learn how a dog looks, you will have to provide pictures of every dog species in the world (there are 360 dog species worldwide). You need to train it on many different images of dogs, from all angles too. All this, just to identify a dog. Another reason why Ai consumes enormous amounts of energy is that it requires many training cycles. With the continued rate of improvement in computer processing efficiency, this problem is mitigated. But even with that, the increase in Ai models being developed and utilized will increase the carbon footprint of Ai. For founders, ensuring your cloud services provider sources clean energy, and the willingness to pay the green premium for it, will further mitigate the negative effects of Ai on the environment. Integrate Your Climate Technology with Ai to Reverse Climate Change When applied creatively, Ai can do wonders to help us mitigate the impacts of climate change. Seeing the solutions climate tech entrepreneurs are coming up with to fight climate change makes me optimistic about the future of Ai for the climate. Right now, most Ai applications within climate tech are making an impact in data analytics and predictions, but I’m excited to see how innovative climate technologists can utilize Ai beyond what’s currently in view.

Warming Up to Climate Tech,"Considerations on The Definition of ""Climate Tech""",,"The term ""climate tech"" was coined to describe technologies that fight climate change. But as the space grows, there is some confusion around what exactly is considered “climate tech” and what doesn’t make the cut. Climate Tech Covers Many Industries Climate change is already affecting the environment and people’s lives substantially, giving innovators and companies in many industries motivation to innovate with the primary goal of mitigating climate change and adapting to its effects. Thanks for reading Warming Up to Climate Tech! Subscribe for free to receive new posts every week. Subscribe Climate tech can be applied across various industries, from energy and transportation to agriculture and construction. It encompasses diverse technologies, including renewable energy, , electric vehicles, , and precision agriculture. The solutions offered by climate tech are not limited to mitigating climate change; they extend to adaptation and resilience-building measures. These may include flood prevention, drought-resistant crops, and resilient infrastructure. Climate tech is technology developed with the primary goal of fighting climate change, whether it be reducing carbon and non-carbon emissions or helping to adapt to the effects of climate change. This is my definition of climate tech, but others in the climate tech sector have slightly different ways of communicating the definition. , “Climate tech is about evolution. The new dawn of climate tech is about acknowledging our planet’s hurtling trajectory towards an unlivable future and rewiring the way we do things to get to any reasonable place.” CTVC also describes climate tech, as opposed to cleantech, as “ a more connected, practical, and future forward transformation measured in tangible impact .” What Is and Isn’t Climate Tech? Climate tech encompasses technologies and innovations that aim to address climate change and its effects, but not all of these technologies or innovations necessarily qualify as climate tech. For example, some companies may market their products as ""green"" or ""eco-friendly"" without actually making a significant impact on reducing emissions and without the primary goal of fighting climate change. What is and isn’t a climate tech is often decided by the Venture Capital firms that focus on investing in the space. Here is what some of the top think is considered “climate tech” and worth investing in: invests in climate tech companies that strictly fall under one of these categories - clean energy, energy efficiency and storage, circular economy, advanced manufacturing and materials, mobility, and food system. focuses on investing in categories like mobility and infrastructure, energy transition-related tech, food and agriculture, and sustainability. , a European VC firm, invests in highly-specific climate tech themes that they know can make an impact in the long run. These themes include health and clean cities, climate-friendly food systems and diets, and circular regenerative economies. said this about their climate tech investments: “ We invest in tech that can save at least 100 Mt of CO2e emissions per year. Startups with such potential will be the most valuable companies of the next decade. The sectors with gigantic decarbonization opportunities are Energy, Food & Agriculture, Manufacturing, Buildings and Transport.” Major VC Investment Themes Within Climate Tech #1. Clean & Renewable Energy Fossil fuels are still the powerhouses for generating electricity; about , and renewable energy is slowly replacing them. About 20% of electricity production comes from renewable sources right now, and the other 19% is from nuclear. Transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy to is one of the major ways to slow down climate change. Renewable energy is a main investment theme for climate tech VCs for good reasons: Reduced carbon emissions: Clean energy technologies such as solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, and bioenergy generate electricity without emitting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. By replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and make substantial progress toward net-zero goals. Improved air quality: Burning fossil fuels not only contributes to climate change but also releases pollutants into the air which have negative health effects on people in immediately surrounding areas of power plants. Renewable energy technologies do not emit pollutants, improving air quality and reducing the risk of respiratory diseases. Established market: Unlike newer markets within climate tech, such as carbon capture, renewable energy is widely proven as a feasible technology to bring to market with clear profit margins. Renewable energy even has a well-established debt-financing history, allowing for greater scalability and near-term impact. Enhanced energy security: As renewable energy sources are distributed they lead to increased energy security. Energy security is the uninterrupted availability of reliable and affordable energy sources, an especially important factor in developing countries. #2. Food & Agriculture of the total greenhouse gas emissions in the US. Nowadays, food and agriculture tech startups are coming up with innovative solutions to reduce the industry’s carbon and methane emissions. These include precision agriculture technologies, alternative protein sources, sustainable packaging and food storage solutions, enhanced weathering, and climate-smart crops. VCs believe these technologies can play a significant role in directly reversing climate change. Sustainable agriculture practices: Agriculture tech can help farmers adopt more sustainable practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as no-till farming, cover cropping, and precision agriculture. Reduced food waste: Food tech can help reduce food waste by improving the efficiency of food storage, transportation, and distribution. Alternative protein sources: Companies can develop alternative protein sources, such as plant-based and lab-grown meat, which have a lower environmental impact than traditional animal agriculture. These alternative protein sources also have the potential to reduce the demand for animal agriculture, which is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Enhanced weathering: Startups like Lithos Carbon are helping farmers maximize the . Spreading optimized amounts of crushed-up basalt (volcanic rock) over soil causes a chemical reaction that allows for the soil to remove carbon from the atmosphere “about 100 to 1,000 times faster.” Innovations like these, combined with other technologies and methods, can eventually make some agricultural companies carbon negative. Climate-smart crops: Technology can help develop climate-smart crops that adapt to changing weather patterns and withstand drought, floods, and other extreme weather events. These crops can help farmers adapt to climate change and maintain food security in the face of increasingly unpredictable weather. #3. Mobility & Transport The mobility and transport sector is the most heavily invested sector by climate tech VCs. The sector is the second-highest greenhouse gas emitter, and from 2013 to 2021, (61% of total VC climate tech investment) in mobility and transportation companies. Electric vehicles: EVs themselves don’t emit greenhouse gases, directly reducing the carbon footprint of the transportation sector and making it possible to replace fossil fuels for vehicles with renewable energy distributed or in the grid. Alternative fuels: Mobility and transport tech can also help develop alternative fuels such as biofuels, fuel cells, and synthetic fuels that emit fewer greenhouse gases than fossil fuels. Smart transportation systems: Smart transportation systems that use real-time data and analytics can help optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion. This can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from idling cars and trucks and improve the efficiency of transportation systems. Sustainable logistics: Logistics tech can help optimize supply chain operations and reduce emissions associated with shipping and transportation. This is primarily done by optimizing routes and using electric vehicles in as many parts of the supply chain as possible. #4. Circular Economy The circular economy is a climate tech theme that helps minimizes waste and reduces the need for new resource extraction and manufacturing processes which can be energy-intensive and emit large amounts of greenhouse gases. Resource conservation and sustainable packaging: New technology can help conserve natural resources by promoting a closed-loop system where materials are recycled, reused, or repurposed rather than discarded and sent to a landfill. This can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with extracting and processing new resources. Waste reduction: Reduce waste by promoting more efficient uses of resources and minimizing the amount of waste generated, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with landfilling and incineration. Energy efficiency: Promote energy efficiency by optimizing production processes and increasing the use of renewable energy sources. Who Decides The Definition of Climate Tech? It seems as though it is the Venture Capitalists who decide what is and isn’t climate tech because they are the ones creating investment theses and then deciding what is worthy of investment under those guidelines. From a startup founder’s perspective, as long as the technology being developed fits into some of the climate tech VC’s theses, they can consider their startup a climate tech startup. But even if VCs aren’t convinced an idea falls under any of the climate tech themes, it’s not game over. Focus on developing innovative solutions that address the root causes of climate change. Ultimately, what matters is the impact of new technology on the environment and society, not the label attached to it.

Warming Up to Climate Tech,Fabulose's New Vegan Leather is Climate Friendly and Durable,"Interview with the founders of Fabulose, an innovator of vegan leather and carbon footprint reduction in fashion.","Fabulose is developing durable vegan leather with the goals of making conventional leather obsolete and reducing carbon emissions and waste. After a year of R&D, they developed a polymer that makes their leather exceed the quality of conventional leather. They are preparing to raise a round of funding so they can scale their leather production for large apparel companies. By replacing leather with a superior option, their innovative product reduces carbon emissions, methane emissions, deforestation, freshwater consumption, and industrial waste. I spoke with the husband-and-wife founding team of Fabulose, Prabu Vijayan and Mohanalaxmi (Mohana) Indramohan, about their founding journey, impact-first mission, and growth plans for the next year. Subscribe to learn more about climate tech and the founders building in it. Subscribe Jacob Sheldon: Tell me about yourselves! Prabu Vijayan: For about 17 years, I have been researching fermentation technologies in the sustainability space. Designing, scaling, building teams, and building technologies for sustainability including sequestering CO 2 through fermentation and producing bioplastics and bioethanol from industrial wastes via fermentation. Mohanalaxmi Indramohan: I have a PhD in Microbiology and Immunology and my primary research focus for more than a decade has been the mechanism of host immune responses during infectious diseases and inflammation. Jacob: Can you describe what Fabulose does? Prabu: Fabulose produces vegan leather from biopolymer obtained from the fermentation of industrial waste that is currently being dumped into landfills and oceans. Our goal is to make conventional leather obsolete by providing a compelling alternative. Our vegan leather can meet leather’s price at scale, is stronger than leather, durable, and versatile yet at an incredibly light environmental footprint. Jacob: What led you to start this company? Prabu: The impacts of climate change are obvious right now to every one of us. If you really look into what is driving it and what is the easiest way to reverse climate change, we can say it's consumer behavior. What we can buy has a direct or substantial impact on climate. If you look at what is one of the major environmental offenders in the fashion world, it is the leather industry which has a massive environmental footprint. We believe that innovating to fix the environmental impact of leather can be one of the most impactful ways to fight climate change. Jacob: What came first, this focus on fighting climate change or the focus on fixing leather? Mohana: I think both go hand in hand. Unless we can find sustainable ways to be fashionable, we will be in deep trouble. You’ve to be passionate about fashion but also find sustainable ways to do it. I think climate action comes first here. It is very hard to think about anything without thinking about the climate angle right now because all of us are affected by it. It's getting warmer, and I don't think we have a choice. Jacob: Did either of you have experience with vegan leather before starting this company? Mohana: Vegan leather as a technology, no. Prabu has experience scaling fermentation, and I have microbiology skills from my research career, and we put it together. Prabu : The fun part is how this was an easy fit for both of us. I have spent years studying biopolymers and secondary metabolites, and I have a background in scaling fermentation technologies. Mohana has incredible experience in biological pathways. With our complementary expertise, it was a natural fit to tackle leather with the biopolymer approach. Our goal was to develop a technology that could be immediately scaled. Jacob: What is the specific problem you're solving? Prabu: Climate change is really the focus, and the easiest way to impact that for us is by providing a compelling alternative to leather. We can meet leather’s price at scale while being so much more sustainable and at the same time meeting or exceeding performance specs. Jacob: If you weren't tackling leather and doing a really great job with it, what would you be doing? Prabu: We have this deep technical understanding of biopolymers and how they can be used to make great biomaterials. When we talk about leather, we are really talking about it as a biomaterial, and its applications are plentiful. In the biomedical world, biomaterials play a huge role. If there is no need to tackle, say, climate change, and with the expertise we have in biotech, we would be happy to use that knowledge to make an impact in the biomedical field. Jacob: How do you see and feel climate change personally in your day-to-day life? Prabu: We are currently traveling in India to establish supply chains for Fabulose. We grew up here and my side of the family is still involved in agriculture, and what we have repeatedly been hearing from our friends and family is that the rain patterns are changing, and it has consequences here where 1/3 rd of the land is rainfed. We noticed that the weather patterns are not the same as they were five or ten years ago. It’s hard not to see that we are experiencing climate change. Jacob: Are there any specific places that you can think of where you've been to and you see such a noticeable change? Mohana: As we drive through villages here, we clearly see the farming cycle is out of sync, especially in South India. Growing up we would see these rivers, and now many of them are dry. That's one prominent example. I think if we're not very prudent about how we use our water supply, we may have major challenges. Jacob: Can you tell me about how creating vegan leather fights climate change? Prabu : The reason we’re so excited about Fabulose is that when compared to conventional leather we use just a fraction of the space and water. It takes us about two liters of water to make one square foot of Fabulose leather. We can even use carbon dioxide off gas to produce it. On the other hand, 80% of deforested amazon is used for ranching. Just 1 sq m of hide generates 16,500 L of wastewater and 110 Kg CO 2 emissions. Mohana: We use a wide variety of industrial waste as a nutrient source in the fermentation process which is another major environmental advantage. Jacob: Is the quality as good or better currently, or is that something you're working on? Prabu: Our material is stronger than leather and we are working on achieving the product versatility of leather so we can compete with it in all categories. Unlike leather, we do not need to treat our material with harsh chemicals which in itself lends several advantages for the planet and the people. Jacob: Who will be buying this from you, brands or factories? Prabu: Both. We have our production and distribution partners, so we understand that brands have been looking for sustainable alternatives for leather due to consumer demand. The demand is deep, and brands want the factories to produce with sustainable alternatives. This goes for vegan leather car seats, handbags, wallets, clothing, and more. Jacob: How large is this market? Prabu: The global market for leather and vegan leather is expected to cross $700 billion and $90 billion respectively by 2030 with CAGR of vegan leather at over 10%. Wherever there is industrial waste, we can make leather there. You don't have to ship from, say, Brazil to Asia, which opens up the market tremendously for our product. This also encourages local manufacturing. There is a big space for us to make a difference. Jacob: Is the team currently just the two of you? Prabu: We are the core team, although we have terrific fractional staff and contract research organizations that work with us. But we're now looking to grow and hire. Jacob: Do you have any immediate hires that you're trying to make in the next few months? Prabu: Once fundraising is complete, we will build out a larger R&D team and onboard a sales team. It will be about eight folks in the next couple of months to really keep pace with the breakthroughs we have achieved in R&D so far and to commercialize that. Jacob: So, you’re currently fundraising. How is that process going? Prabu: We just got started after waiting for data to show that we are better than the current options in price and performance. We’re now just a few weeks in and the response is great. We're hoping to form some long-term partnerships pretty soon. Jacob: How do you two as a team, as a married co-founding team, work together? Mohana: It's easier in the sense that we both had worked on working well with each other as a couple much before we started Fabulose. That allows us to be realistic and transparent especially when we have contradicting ideas. I think what really matters is that we look at the company objectively as an entity and set measurable goals to progress. We are clear about where our professional strengths are and set specific goals for us which will move the company forward. Jacob: How do you quantify your impact on the climate? Prabu: We are building models right now to track that as we understand that we could impact the climate in multiple ways. Apart from what I’ve mentioned already, there’s also the supply chain aspect. Plus, we’re minimizing industrial waste, saving water, saving forests, and cutting down major greenhouse gas emissions. The exact carbon and methane emissions reduction is still a work in progress. In a month or two we should have a solid handle on our numbers to accurately answer that question as there is a range of waste we can utilize which can all provide various positive impacts. Jacob: What is one thing you do really well as founders? Prabu: As a founder-couple of an early-stage startup, not driving each other crazy is very important in our opinion. It’s great to help the world be sustainable, but we can’t lose our sanity in the process. We both make a conscious and proactive to have sustainable mental health. People do different things to relax, and for us, it is yogic breathing techniques. Sudarshan Kriya breathing exercise is effective for us in achieving sustainable mental health. That is a conscious effort we take to function effectively. Jacob: What's your biggest blocker right now? Mohana: A couple of months ago, if you'd asked this we'd have given you lots of answers. But right now, we are in a happy stage. We have achieved what we set out to do, and we're just ready to hit greater scale. Prabu: We were waiting for the day we could showcase a really good alternative to leather. Now we are ready to go, talk to mission-aligned people in the investor community, and scale. Jacob: Why had no one cracked this before? Prabu: Many companies have in their own right addressed the sustainability angle in various dimensions, and we went on this path of creating an alternative that offers such a compelling value that it becomes easy to pick our product over leather. We started off with this as the goal and not just to make a greener alternative. This is where we spent a lot of time strategizing how we should structure the technology, where we could make it, and how to make scalability easy. Jacob: What is your goal for the company this year? Prabu: We plan to pilot the product in Q3 and have it commercially available in Q4, and it’s quite within reach.

Warming Up to Climate Tech,How Climate Tech VCs Think About Investing in Startups,Research and analysis of some of the top climate tech VC firms to understand how they invest and who they invest in.,"Climate tech is a focus that many new and existing venture capital firms have taken with the overarching goal of fighting climate change. These incredibly mission-driven VCs believe that their time is best spent finding and investing in companies that innovate to reduce carbon emissions, help the planet heal, and help us live in the changing climate. To understand how climate tech VC firms are thinking about how they invest and who they invest in, I looked up the top climate tech investors and analyzed their theses. Subscribe What Top Climate Tech Investors Focus On #1. Breakthrough Energy Ventures (BEV) Startup stages: Pre-seed, Seed, Series A Climate tech sectors BEV invests in: Advanced nuclear power, Grid-scale storage, Bioenergy, transportation, Industrial processes helps finance, launch, and scale companies that eliminate the emission of greenhouse gas through the global economy.

The venture has raised more than $2 billion in capital and supported over 90 companies to date. It invests in companies that can: Create technologies with the potential to reduce greenhouse gases, at scale, by at least half a gigaton every year Has the capability to attract other investors Fill critical gaps in climate technology #2. ArcTern Ventures Startup stages: All stages of startups Climate tech sectors Arctern Ventures invests in: Clean energy, Energy efficiency, Energy storage, Circular economy, Mobility, Food systems was founded in 2012 when two former startup founders came together to invest in entrepreneurs obsessed with solving humanity’s greatest challenges - climate change and sustainability. Here are some of the things ArcTern Ventures believes in: All forms of transportation will be autonomous and electric in the coming years New molecules for sustainable materials will be discovered in days, not years Most meat will be lab-grown, not raised The venture invests in all stages of startups but only with specific climate tech applications. #3. ENGIE New Ventures Startup stages: Series A and B Climate tech sectors ENGIE New Ventures invests in: Renewable energy, Network solutions, Low carbon H2, Decarbonization solutions, Thermal energy decarbonization, and Energy management solutions with €200 million to invest in clean tech startups. Their mission is to invest in scalable startups that can digitize, decarbonize, and decentralize the world of energy. It was founded in 2014, and since then ENGIE has invested in more than 35 innovative startups. The venture doesn’t entertain seed-stage startups; they invest in startups who have proven their technology or business model and are ready to scale but are still at the early stage (Series A or B rounds) . Additionally, the startups they invest in must also fit one or more ENGIE group business units. #4. Congruent Ventures Startup stages: Pre-seed and Seed invests in early-stage startups that are commercializing climate solutions, generating a positive environmental impact, and producing market-rate returns. The venture was founded in 2017 and its fund II was launched in 2021. The four major categories of climate tech Congruent Ventures invest in are: Mobility and Utilization Energy Transformation Food and Agriculture Production and Consumption So far, the firm has invested in 43 companies out of which 72% have had a further funding round. Why Investors Are Focusing on Climate Tech Almost everyone knows the severity of climate change if it’s not controlled. Companies coming up with innovative are creating the . But to fight climate change, these companies need enormous amounts of money, and there’s only so much the government can provide through and incentives. In 2022, VCs across the world invested a total of $70.1 billion, up 89% from 2021, into climate tech companies. Lowercabon Capital - Chris Sacca is concerned about the extremely high levels of CO2 in the atmosphere In his thesis, Chris signifies the in the Earth’s atmosphere. “ Today, the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere are higher than at any point in at least 800,000 years (and arguably as far back as 23 million). Pumping all this CO2 into the sky is like locking ourselves in a car on a sunny day.” This concern is one of the main reasons that so many VCs are willing to take bets on climate technology companies. According to him, to bring down CO2 levels in the atmosphere, the world will have to: Reduce the emission of CO2 and other greenhouse gases to zero Remove approximately a trillion tons of carbon dioxide that’s already in the atmosphere Buy humanity as much time as possible to reduce carbon emissions For this to happen, everyone - the VCs, governments, startups, and even the average person will have to work in tandem. Breakthrough Energy Ventures - We need to invest in climate tech so we can get to net-zero emissions by 2050 Breakthrough Energy believes that humanity has faced. That’s because every piece of tech we use in our day-to-day lives emits carbon and it’s quite a challenge to replace everything with clean tech by 2050. Bill Gates, the founder of BEV said: “Great ideas are just the beginning. We need a plan—and the willingness to do the hard work—so we can get on track over the next decade and hit our goal of net-zero emissions by 2050."" The two things that matter the most right now are the extremely innovative ideas to fight climate change and the money to make those ideas a reality. BeyondNetZero - We can reduce carbon emissions and build a profitable business at the same time BeyonNetZero works with entrepreneurs to grow their companies if they have proven ideas for reducing greenhouse gases. The Chairman of BeyondNetZero, Lord Browne of Madingley said: “There are two things that the venture focuses on: Does our investment reduce greenhouse gases? Does it actually produce profitable results?” The firm has a rigorous process to shortlist its investments, and they specify a deadline for each of its investments to achieve net-zero carbon emissions. This approach ensures their investments are not just good for the environment but also help them achieve profitability and scale effectively. Aspects Climate VCs Look For Before Investing Energy Transition Speed - Blue Bear Capital “Our model is contingent on acknowledging the speed with which the energy transition is occurring, and our LPs have found alignment with our approach.” - , partner, . Blue Bear Capital invests in climate tech companies that can reverse climate change quickly. The companies they invest in must be able to scale their clean energy solutions quickly. This way, Blue Bear can focus their time and efforts on introducing their portfolio companies to customers and others who can increase the rate of adoption. Net Impact - Closed Loop Partners “Our investments in the circular economy align capitalism with positive social and environmental impact by reducing waste and greenhouse gas emissions via materials innovation, advanced recycling technologies, supply chain optimization, and keeping materials in play. We measure our impact according to four key pillars that underpin the acceleration toward a circular economy” - . Some VCs, like Closed Loop, prioritize investment based on the net impact a company has on the environment, and they use that to calculate the firm’s impact too. They review an impact statement given to them by founders and run a thorough analysis from their side. This requirement is key to them sticking to their original goal of fighting climate change. Returns & Profits - Congruent Ventures “We’re looking at real businesses here, so we’re not going to invest in anything that doesn’t have a fairly clear business model, or at least a choice of business models and a path to exit that doesn’t require an indefinite generous government subsidy.” - , co-founder and managing partner, . Congruent Ventures doesn’t invest in companies that don’t have a sound business model in place or have a clear path to exit. As a firm with LPs for whom to get a return on investment, it’s not surprising that they have these requirements for their startups before they invest. It’s essential for climate tech startups not just to have pie-in-the-sky goals but to have a reasonable plan to reach them. Decarbonizing the World and Generating Profits Go Hand-in-Hand If we want to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, governments will have to find ways to reduce the costs of carbon-free equipment, VCs will have to keep investing heavily in climate technology, and people will have to consider buying products that are more expensive but sustainable in the long term.

Warming Up to Climate Tech,The Recent Nuclear Fusion Breakthrough,"A California nuclear fusion research facility had a breakthrough in December 2022, marking a huge step forward. Learn about nuclear fusion, how itÉ","The National Ignition Facility (NIF), located in California, had a breakthrough on December 5th, 2022 that marks a critical step forward for nuclear fusion development. “Scientists have been trying to make such a breakthrough for 60 years and finally the day has come,” said E. Craig Dukes, an expert in experimental high-energy physics in his recent interview. Before we get into the breakthrough and what it means, let’s go over what nuclear fusion is and how it works. Subscribe How Nuclear Fusion Works Nuclear fusion is a process of combining two atomic nuclei to form a single, heavier one. When this happens, the reaction releases energy. This reaction takes place naturally in the sun and all the stars you see in the sky. In order to fuse together, these nuclei must collide with each other at extremely high temperatures - around 10 million degree Celsius. This high temperature is required for these nuclei to overcome their mutual electrical repulsion. Electric repulsion is a type of electrical interaction that occurs between two charged particles when they have the same electrical charge. When two charged particles are close to each other and they have the same charge (either both positive or both negative), they will experience an electric repulsive force that pushes them away from each other. Once they overcome this repulsion, they combine releasing a massive amount of energy, which is the main reason why scientists worldwide are working on it. The key to understanding how fusion generates energy is Einstein's world-renowned equation: E = mc2 The equation states that the energy (E) of a body is equal to its mass (m) multiplied by the speed of light (c) squared. The speed of light is a very large number, around 300,000,000 meters per second, so even a small amount of mass is equal to a very large amount of energy. The inclusion of c2 in the equation is important because it shows that the relationship between mass and energy is not linear. In other words, increasing the mass of an object does not increase its energy by the same amount. Instead, the increase in energy is much greater than the increase in mass. Where nuclear fusion helps combine two atom nuclei, nuclear fission is the exact opposite. It’s a process in which the nucleus of an atom is split into two or more smaller, more stable nuclei. This process releases a large amount of energy, which can be harnessed to generate electricity in a nuclear power plant. Nuclear Fusion vs. Nuclear Fission Nuclear fission is comparatively easier to achieve than nuclear fusion because it requires less energy and temperatures to split an atom’s nucleus. But apart from this, there are several differences between fusion and fission: Fuel: Nuclear fusion reactions use light elements such as hydrogen as fuel, while nuclear fission reactions use heavier elements such as uranium or plutonium. Byproducts: Nuclear fusion produces much less radioactive waste than nuclear fission. The byproducts of nuclear fusion reactions are typically stable, while those of nuclear fission reactions are highly radioactive and require careful handling and disposal. Safety: Nuclear fusion reactions are generally considered to be safer than nuclear fission reactions, as they do not produce the same kind of dangerous radioactive waste. Practicality: While nuclear fusion has the potential to provide a virtually limitless and clean energy source, it’s still a relatively new field of research and has not yet been fully developed for practical use. In contrast, nuclear fission has been used for decades to generate electricity in nuclear power plants. About the Fusion Experiment Conducted at the National Ignition Facility A team of scientists conducted an experiment wherein 192 laser beams were converged on a small gold cylinder consisting of a tiny bead of fuel composed of two hydrogen isotopes: Deuterium and Tritium. This cylinder vaporized in seconds, emitting X-rays that bombarded the fuel pellet, that turned the fuel’s outer diamond layer into plasma that led to fuel compression to a point where its nuclei fused and released tremendous amounts of energy. But here’s the key to this experiment resulting in a breakthrough - the energy release was about 50% more than the energy imparted by the experiment’s lasers . The laser energy heated the fuel pellet to 150 million degree Celsius and compressed it with a pressure that’s 2X compared to the sun’s center. The laser beams put in 2.05 megajoules of energy and the fusion reaction released 3.15 megajoules. This 3.15 megajoules of energy can be captured and used to generate electricity. What Does the Breakthrough Mean for Nuclear Fusion & The World? If nuclear fusion can be replicated on earth at an industrial scale, it can be the source of unlimited clean, safe, and affordable energy to meet the ever increasing needs of our planet. One Step Closer to Commercializing Nuclear Fusion With this breakthrough, the world is one step closer to commercializing nuclear fusion, but it's a long road ahead. The recent experiment surely released more energy than the energy required to combine the two atom nuclei. But to carry out nuclear fusion you must power the reactor used to combine these atom nuclei. In this case, the power required by the reactor was 300 megajoules. Thus, the 3 megajoules energy released after combining the nuclei was just 1% of the total energy used for the nuclear fusion process. This means we are several steps away from the day where nuclear fusion might replace fission to resolve the clean energy issue. There is no doubt about the progress in the nuclear fusion world. It's happening fast, but it will take a long time to generate affordable electricity with nuclear fusion. More Funding for Fusion is Needed Although last year wasn’t great for nuclear fusion funding, with this breakthrough at the end of the year, investors are expected to invest in nuclear fusion heavily. Past 10 Years of Nuclear Fusion Funding Many private investors have been investing in nuclear fusion for a long time, but the private investment in fusion energy has accelerated in recent years. By the end of 2020, the investment stood at $1.5 billion, and it almost tripled in 2021 ($4.44 billion). The reason behind this investment growth is a combination of traditional tech venture funding and strategic investments by incumbent energy companies like Eni’s and Eqinor’s. Next-Gen Nuclear Fission Is Still a Much More Viable Option Investment in the Near Term It’s true that fusion could generate substantially more energy than fission, but it’s still a moonshot. The manufacturing of equipment required for the fusion process is extremely expensive and the power required to make it a feasible energy source is immense. It would take a long time to commercialize nuclear fusion, and with the current climate change crisis, it would be too late. It still requires a lot of technological development to become feasible. That’s why it's important to continue investing in nuclear fission in the meantime as it is also a clean source of energy that can replace fossil fuels to generate electricity.

Warming Up to Climate Tech,The Inflation Reduction Act - Reducing Inflation or Increasing Climate Funding?,"The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) commits a huge amount of money to fight inflation and climate change, but itÕs important to highlight how it is putÉ","Climate tech companies are a vital component of the fight against climate change as they develop and bring to market innovative technologies that help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of a changing climate. These companies often face significant challenges including the high cost of research and development, difficulty obtaining funding, and the need to compete with established players in the energy and technology sectors. To fight these challenges, and at the same time fight rising inflation, the US government passed the Inflation Reduction Act in August of 2022. Thanks for reading Warming Up to Climate Tech! Subscribe for free to receive new posts every month. Subscribe The Inflation Reduction Act Establishes and Extends Tax Credits and Loans The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), is a piece of legislation that has had a significant impact on the climate tech industry. The IRA aims to reduce inflation and stabilize prices by encouraging businesses to invest in technology that can improve energy efficiency and develop new technologies that benefit the climate. One of the key provisions of the IRA is the creation of a tax credit for businesses that invest in climate tech. This credit is designed to encourage businesses to adopt technologies that can reduce their carbon footprint and mitigate the impacts of climate change. For example, a company that installs solar panels or invests in energy-efficient equipment may be eligible for a tax credit under the IRA. In addition to the tax credit, the IRA also provides funding for research and development in the climate tech sector. This funding is intended to help emerging startups develop and commercialize new technologies that can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, decrease use of fossil fuels, and much more. These tax credits are beneficial to initiatives such as the , of which 378 companies and counting have signed onto and promised to reduce their carbon footprints to zero by 2040. The monetary incentives now available are expected to boost the number of companies signing on to the Climate Pledge and other similar initiatives. Electric Vehicle Startups Can Lower their Manufacturing Costs with the New IRA Policy The IRA allocates and consumers buying EVs out of the total $369 billion in the bill. Under the inflation reduction act, the US legislation extends a program that provides $7,500 in tax credits to consumers who buy EVs. But for consumers to claim this benefit, manufacturers have to follow new guidelines: Car batteries must be made using critical minerals that are recycled, mined, and processed in the US (or any country with which the US has a free trade agreement) Most of the final assembly of the battery packs has to take place in North America To qualify, a company has to follow both of these requirements in under three years starting 2024. But the legislation also has a provision of partly incentivising consumers who buy EVs from companies that meet the requirements half-way. This means customers can claim a tax credit of $3,750 if you follow just one of the two requirements. These tax credits for buying EVs are helpful but don’t yet tip the balance with gas vehicles. The average cost of an EV is ($67,291) than the overall new car market average. People are already quite reluctant to buy EVs because of the cost associated. With the new requirements under IRA, if a company wants their electric vehicles to qualify, they need to use more expensive US-made parts when compared to importing parts from China. In order to survive in the market, these electric vehicle companies won’t have a choice but to increase the price of the vehicles. Even with the tax credit of $7,500, it will be a challenge to lower manufacturing costs and make EVs more affordable. Current Status of EVs , there are 72 EV models available for purchase in the United States and three major types: battery, plug-in hybrid, and fuel cell electric vehicles. 70% of these vehicles currently do not meet either of the new requirements and not even a single EV model currently meets both requirements. Existing electric vehicle companies like Rivian are not happy with the tax credit concept under the IRA. In an interview with they acknowledged two major issues: The first is the manufacturing of EVs in North America or a partner country under a free trade agreement with the U.S. The second issue is the price limit on electric pick-up trucks or SUVs set at $80,000. This means for consumers to claim the full $7,500 tax credit on electric pick-up trucks the price of the truck must be less than $80,000, plus the consumer must make less than $150,000 as individual income-earners or less than $300,000 for those filing jointly. Rivian is not happy because they recently increased their SUV price from $72,500 to $84,500, making it invalid for buyers to claim the tax credits under the new IRA rules. The two major challenges for existing players in EV manufacturing are: To create EV batteries as per IRA requirements Finding a lower cost way of manufacturing EV batteries in the US Adjusting prices so that they’re inline with the $80k limit Tax Credits Extended For Solar, Wind, and Geothermal Through 2024 The IRA extends Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and Production Tax Credit (PTC) for solar, wind, geothermal, biogas, combined heat and power (CHP) facilities, as well as microgrid projects that begin construction before December 31, 2025. To claim the enhanced 30% ITC and 2.6 cents per kilowatt PTC businesses must follow the . Stand-alone energy storage companies will be benefited from IRA as they can now claim ITC without connecting the energy storage devices to solar projects. Another benefit of tax credit extension in the energy sector is for solar projects that use domestically produced materials. If the total materials for the project you’re building are 40% US-made, your project will qualify for a 10% increase in the ITC. There’s also a 10-20% increase in the ITC if your project is related to the - a type or project where the majority of the employees hired are from oil, gas, and coal sectors or is located in an - a low-income community or tribal land. New Loans for Clean Energy Companies The inflation reduction act launched a new loan program called Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment (EIR) which will help update, repurpose, and replace energy infrastructure to increase clean energy production. The IRA has allocated $5 billion in funds to be distributed as loans under EIR until September 5, 2026. The total funds allocated to EIR have now reached an impressive $250 billion. The three types of projects that can attain loans under EIR are: Repurpose shuttered fossil fuel facilities for clean energy production Retooling energy infrastructure Updating operating energy infrastructure with emissions control technologies More Loan Initiatives within the IRA Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) Direct Loan Program: $3 billion credit subsidy and a fund of ~$40 billion in loans to support manufacturing of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, locomotives, aviation, and hyperloop. Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program (TELGP): Increased the loan amount available from $2 billion to $20 billion so that Tribes all across the US can apply for loans to build energy-related projects. Innovative Clean Energy (ICE): $40 billion in loans available to all eligible Title 17 Innovative Clean Energy technology categories. Consumer Incentives by IRA will Make Products More Affordable The IRA announced ~$43 billion in tax credits to help by making products like solar panels, heat pumps, and home batteries more affordable. These consumer incentives will persuade people to buy environmentally friendly products. This will also help climate tech companies increase their sales and incentivize more startups to enter the consumer climate tech space. Some of the consumer incentives that will be available from the start of 2023 are: $7,500 tax credit for EVs that adhere to the criteria set by the IRA (the same one explained above) Qualifying home improvements like Energy Star exterior windows and doors, central air conditioners, heat pumps, boilers and other renewable energy equipments be eligible for a tax credit of up to 30% of the total cost (capped at $1,200 yearly) The Inflation Reduction Act Will be a Game Changer In 2023 & Beyond With hundreds of billions of dollars committed to fight climate change, the IRA is going to be a game changer for existing and upcoming companies dedicated to investing in climate technology. At the same time, companies might have to rethink their manufacturing and production strategies in order to adhere to the rules and regulations implemented by the IRA that are aimed at reducing inflation as well. What’s clear is that the IRA provides a massive boost to climate tech companies and incentivizes other companies to implement more climate friendly technology. We hope the IRA is just the start, inspiring many more programs from governments around the world to provide substantial climate funding. Thanks for reading Warming Up to Climate Tech!

Warming Up to Climate Tech,The History of Climate Tech as a Tool to Fight Climate Change,Climate tech's role in reversing climate change has taken a huge step up.,"Look at the evolution of technology in the last century and you’ll agree we’ve come a long way. But the same technology has been polluting the environment, damaging our planet, and raising our planet’s temperature. The question that arises here is - if technology evolution has been the cause of climate change, can climate technology be the solution? This article explores the problems our planet faces due to climate change, the state of climate tech investment to date, and what the future holds for climate technology. Subscribe What Research Reports Have to Say About Climate Tech Earth's temperature has risen by 0.08°C every decade since 1880, but yearly, the rate of warming has more than doubled at 0.18°C. Due to lower carbon dioxide emissions in the past, the temperature rise wasn't an issue, but since 1980, the Earth's temperature has been rising severely. If left unchecked, it will lead to extreme living conditions. The increase in temperature not just affects humans but also has a significant impact on most animals, freshwater, and many more resources. Below are just a few primary examples of how climate change is affecting the resources of the Earth. Temperature Rise Due to Climate Change Due to the rise in greenhouse gas emissions, the global surface temperature is on the rise. Nearly the entire planet is seeing more and more hot weather, making it difficult for people to work outside. Apart from this, due to the heat, wildfires start more quickly and spread across vast areas burning topsoil and making the land non-fertile. Rising Temperatures Cause Extreme Rain and Snow, Water Scarcity As the world becomes warmer year by year, water evaporation will keep increasing, and the dryer conditions due to evaporation will lead to scarcity of freshwater. Warmer air holds more moisture than cool air. As a result, the clouds will be able to hold more water, resulting in heavier rains and snowfalls, paving the way for natural calamities like floods, droughts, and extreme weather. This water change has already begun in the US, as clusters of thunderstorms have become more frequent. With the Earth becoming warmer due to climate change, water evaporation will keep rising. The supply of freshwater will continue to decrease alongside an increase in demand. Here’s how climate change can affect US water withdrawals if the temperature keeps increasing. Loss of Animal Species As the temperature of the Earth rises, it's becoming more challenging for fish to survive in the water and for animals to live on land. The planet is losing animal species 1,000 times faster than at any other time in recorded history. A million species are at risk of extinction in the next decade if the temperature keeps rising the way it is. Food Scarcity Temperature changes affect fish, livestock, and plants the most and reduce their nutrition levels. With climate change, the acidic level in water bodies keeps rising, which endangers billions of marine life. Heat stress also diminishes water and grasslands for grazing, leading to declining crop yields. Increasing Health Risks Change in climate is already impacting human health due to an increase in air pollution, disease, extreme weather conditions, and food scarcity. Such environmental factors take the lives of about 13 million people every year. The list of climate change impacts is endless, but people have been trying to reverse climate change for decades, and billions of dollars have been invested in climate tech startups just in the past year. The Story of Climate Tech From 2015 to 2021 2015-16: Rising Concern of Climate Change Amongst Governments In 2015, heatwaves, forest fires, storms, and droughts were already hurting the environment, resulting in loss of life, reduced quality of life, and noticeable temperature rise. Since then, the frequency of natural calamities and climate-related hazards has increased everywhere. Every region worldwide has been investing a significant amount of money to fight climate change. In 2015-16, the major source of climate tech investment was market-rate loans provided by multilateral and national DFIs in sectors like water and waste-water management, agriculture, forestry, land-use, and natural resources management. 2016-18: Climate Tech Investment Crossed Half Trillion Mark The three years from 2016-2018 saw a substantial increase in climate tech investment from the North American and East Asia regions. A quarter of this investment was made because of the rise of EVs and to build sustainable infrastructure. In 2017, climate financing reached a record high of $612 billion, driven particularly by renewable energy capacity additions in China, the U.S., and India, as well as increased public commitments to land use and energy efficiency. This funding was a drop in the bucket compared to the estimate of investment needed to decrease world temperatures by 1.5°C. It's estimated that to decrease the temperature by 1.5°C by 2050, the world needs a yearly investment ranging from . Even though the overall climate tech investment dropped in 2018, it was a crucial moment for climate tech startups because venture capitalists started showing interest and investing heavily in the field. 2019: A Drop In Climate Tech Investment from VCs Although VC investments in have grown at almost five times the rate of the overall global venture capital market, 2019 saw a small drop. In 2019, the funding from VC was comparatively less, but it was primarily focused on seed and series A stage startups, implying a healthy pipeline of younger firms continuing to enter the market, lining up to approach more mature funding milestones in the coming years. Most of these startups focused on reducing carbon emissions by using renewable energy sources (mainly solar). 2020-2021: VC Investment Keeps Rising, But Is It Enough? 2020 was the year when hit an all-time high of $16.4 billion worldwide. Most of the money invested was in startups in their later stages. With Covid-19 impacting the world, the overall climate tech investment was slow in the latter half of 2020. But, the investment skyrocketed in 2021 and hasn't slowed since then. 2021-2022: The Boom In Climate Tech Investment 2021 was a record-breaking year for VC climate tech investment, with $32 billion raised by startups (through September 2021). Around $18 billion of the total investment has come from the USA, and Canada, followed by $9 billion from Europe. Where We Are Currently with Climate Tech With the Q4 data of 2022 still to come, the VC climate tech investment so far has been around $79 billion. Comparing just Q1-Q3 in 2021 and 2022, we’re seeing a greater than 4x increase in VC investment into climate tech startups YoY. This is a huge increase, especially considering the global drop in VC investments across all industries. Currently, about 44,000 startups are trying to fight climate change and create new revolutionary technologies; this number is estimated to reach 66.5K by 2030. Here are the eight climate tech areas of focus to which these startups belong: The above graph depicts that people are inclined to leverage renewable energy sources to generate electricity and clean fuel. As a result, investors are also inclined to invest in energy-related projects the most, followed by Mobility. 2023 & Beyond: The Future of Climate Tech According to several climate tech reports, VCs and other investors are focused on two sectors that might make the biggest climate impact in the next decade - Increasing the use of renewable energy and electric vehicle production . Governments and VCs worldwide are trying to fund and support startups that are coming up with alternative methods to produce electricity that doesn't involve fossil fuel. Although the growth of EVs has been slow in the last decade, people can now see the importance of switching away from their gas vehicles, and there are numerous brands like Rivian, NIO, Li Auto trying to manufacture and bring new EVs onto the market. VCs have also started investing in sectors like food technology, carbon accounting, sustainable fashion, and many more sectors that are considered to be a part of climate tech. Being a startup, climate tech companies face similar challenges to larger corporations, just on a smaller scale. The that climate tech startups face are: Growth initiatives - Building partnerships Expanding overseas Scaling operations - Engineering and Tech Considering the challenges climate tech startups face and the massive potential for profit and climate impact that they have, it’s no surprise that VCs will play a crucial role as investors in climate tech in the coming years.
