## Primary goal - demonstrate new possibilities

- A hackathon can show what happens when a concept is taken to the next level

- It's great for job seekers who want to network and prove their talent

- It's great for companies that want to share open data and make more use of it


## Instructions

Read through the [The 10 Step Hackathon Guide](https://opensource.com/article/23/2/hackathon-guide) from opensource.com.

## Try a Virtual Hackathon

They are easier to organize:

- No venue is required

- Attendees can show up from home

- Demos are easier and the audience can easily give feedback and participate over Zoom's chat function

- Demos are simple to record and share after the event along with slides

## Example: Bayou Energy

[Bayou Energy](https://bayou.energy) is a startup that provides utility data through an API.

They organized a [Utility Data Hackathon](https://blog.bayou.energy/blog/utility-data-hackathon-wrap-up-december-2023), which is a perfect fit.

By opening up a valuable source of free data, participants could easily generate new innovative applications in a short period of time.

Here is an example demo from the first place winner, "Grid Link", a robo advisor for Energy Markets.
