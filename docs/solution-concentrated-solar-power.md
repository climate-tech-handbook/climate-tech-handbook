## Progress Made

Significant advancements have been made in CSP technologies and practices:

1. **Fresnel Mirrors**: Thinner, lighter mirrors concentrate solar radiation over larger areas, boosting efficiency.
2. **Molten Salt Storage**: Molten salt stores solar energy for up to 12 hours, enabling power generation during non-sunny periods.
3. **Leading Innovators**: Companies like SolarReserve, BrightSource Energy, and Abengoa Solar are pioneering large-scale CSP plants.

## Solutions by Sector

### Utility-Scale Power Generation
