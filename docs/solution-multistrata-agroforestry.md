## Overview

Multistrata agroforestry is a type of agroforestry that involves growing trees and crops in layers. This type of agroforestry has been shown to reverse climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Some of the breakthrough technologies that have been developed for multistrata agroforestry include:

1. Trees that can be grown in the understory of existing forests. These trees are known as understory trees. Understory trees can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by sequestering carbon dioxide.
2. Crops that can be grown in the understory of existing forests. These crops are known as understory crops. Understory crops can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by sequestering carbon dioxide.
3. Trees that can be grown in the canopy of existing forests. These trees are known as canopy trees. Canopy trees can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by providing shade and by sequestering carbon dioxide.

Some of the companies and organizations that have been at the forefront of developing multistrata agroforestry include the World Agroforestry Centre, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, and the United States Department of Agriculture.

## Progress Made

Multistrata agroforestry is a type of agriculture that incorporates trees into traditional farming landscapes. The trees provide shade and windbreaks for crops, improve soil fertility, and help to conserve water. Multistrata agroforestry has been shown to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by sequestering carbon in the trees and soil. In addition, the trees can provide fuel for energy-efficient cookstoves, which reduces emissions from cooking and heating.

Organizations such as the World Agroforestry Centre and the International Centre for Research in Agroforestry are working to promote multistrata agroforestry as a climate-friendly farming practice. In addition, a number of companies are developing breakthrough technologies to support multistrata agroforestry, including precision agriculture tools, drone-based mapping tools, and software to help farmers design and manage agroforestry systems.

## Lessons Learned

1. One of the key lessons that has been learned in the development and implementation of Multistrata Agroforestry to reverse climate change is the importance of diversification. Diversifying the types of crops grown and the trees planted can help to reduce the risk of crop failure and provide a more stable income for farmers.
2. Another key lesson is the importance of proper land management. Improper land management can lead to soil erosion, which can degrade the quality of the land and make it less productive.
3. It is also important to consider the needs of the local ecosystem when developing and implementing a Multistrata Agroforestry system. The system should be designed to support the local ecosystem, rather than trying to replace it.
4. One of the biggest lessons learned is that multistrata agroforestry systems need to be adaptable. Climate change is resulting in changes in weather patterns and local ecosystems. Farmers need to be able to adapt their systems to these changes in order to be successful.
5. Finally, it is important to remember that multistrata agroforestry is a long-term investment. The benefits of the system will not be seen overnight. It takes time for trees to grow and for the system to become established. Patience is important when developing and implementing a Multistrata Agroforestry system.

## Challenges Ahead

The major challenges that remain in the development and implementation of Multistrata Agroforestry to reverse climate change are:

1. Ensuring long-term sustainability of the system: There is a need to design multistrata agroforestry systems that are economically viable and environmentally sustainable in the long term. This includes developing systems that are resilient to climate change and can provide a wide range of ecosystem services.
2. Scaling up and widely adopting the technology: Multistrata agroforestry is still a relatively new technology and needs to be scaled up and widely adopted in order to have a significant impact on climate change. This requires overcoming various technical and economic obstacles, such as the high initial investment costs.
3. Increasing public awareness and understanding: There is a need to increase public awareness and understanding of multistrata agroforestry in order to build support for its development and implementation. This includes educating people about the potential benefits of the technology and how it can help fight climate change.

Some companies and organizations that have been at the forefront of developing and promoting multistrata agroforestry include the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR).

## Best Path Forward

The best path forward for the continued development and implementation of Multistrata Agroforestry to effectively mitigate the effects of climate change is to continue to research and develop the technology and to promote its adoption on a large scale. Steps that need to be taken to ensure that this technology is adopted on a large scale and is effective include:

1. Increasing awareness of the technology and its potential benefits
2. Conducting more research to improve the technology and to assess its effectiveness
3. Working with governments and other organizations to promote the adoption of the technology
4. Providing financial incentives to farmers and other landowners to adopt the technology
5. Establishing demonstration projects to show the potential of the technology

Some companies and organizations that have been at the forefront of promoting Multistrata Agroforestry include the World Agroforestry Centre, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, and the United States Forest Service.
