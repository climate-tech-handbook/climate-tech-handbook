## Overview

In the past decade, managed grazing has made great strides in reversing climate change. Through the use of new technologies, managed grazing has been able to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. One of the most important breakthrough technologies has been the development of grazing management software. This software has allowed ranchers to more accurately monitor and manage their grazing herds. As a result, ranchers have been able to reduce their herds’ impact on the environment and significantly reduce their carbon footprint.

Other important technologies that have been developed include GPS-based grazing management systems and remote sensing systems. These technologies have allowed ranchers to more accurately monitor their herds’ movements and grazing patterns. As a result, they have been able to reduce overgrazing and improve grazing management practices.

Some of the companies and organizations that have been at the forefront of developing and promoting managed grazing include the Environmental Defense Fund, the Natural Resources Conservation Service, and the Savory Institute.

## Progress Made

Over the last few years, there has been an increasing focus on developing managed grazing systems to help reverse climate change. A number of different technologies have been developed to help improve the efficiency of grazing systems and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

One example of a breakthrough technology is the use of satellite-based remote sensing to help map and monitor grazing areas. This information can be used to better understand how grazing systems are interacting with the landscape and identify opportunities for improvement.

A number of companies and organizations have been working on developing and implementing managed grazing systems. Some of the leading organizations include the Savory Institute, the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef, and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

## Lessons Learned

In the development and implementation of Managed Grazing to reverse climate change, some key lessons that have been learned include the importance of grazing management, the need for proper grazing infrastructure, and the value of grazing animals as a carbon sink. However, there have also been some failures associated with the technology, including overgrazing and the depletion of soil carbon.

One of the successes of managed grazing has been the ability to improve soil health and water infiltration. This has been accomplished through the use of rotational grazing, in which animals are only allowed to graze in a particular area for a short period of time before being moved to another area. This allows the plants in the grazed area to recover and results in healthier soils. In addition, managed grazing can help to increase the amount of carbon in the soil.

However, there have also been some failures associated with managed grazing. One of the biggest problems has been overgrazing, in which animals are allowed to graze for too long and eat too much, leading to the depletion of soil carbon. Another problem has been the lack of proper grazing infrastructure, which has led to the depletion of water resources and the spread of invasive species.

## Challenges Ahead

The major challenge that remains in the development and implementation of Managed Grazing to reverse climate change is the lack of awareness and understanding of the potential benefits of this technology. There is a need to educate and engage key stakeholders, including policy makers, farmers, and the general public, on the benefits of managed grazing in order to overcome the obstacles to its widespread adoption. Additionally, further research is needed to quantify the carbon sequestration potential of managed grazing and to develop standardized protocols for its implementation.

Organizations such as the Savory Institute and the Grasslands Foundation are at the forefront of promoting managed grazing as a solution to climate change. The Savory Institute has developed the Holistic Management Framework, which provides a systematic approach to planning and managing grazing systems that mimics the natural ecosystem. The Grasslands Foundation is working to increase the adoption of managed grazing systems through education and training programs.

Studies have shown that managed grazing can increase soil carbon levels by up to 10%. In one study, managed grazing was found to increase soil organic matter by 0.7% per year over a 10-year period, while in another study, managed grazing increased soil organic matter by 1.3% per year over a 15-year period. These studies suggest that managed grazing has the potential to sequester a significant amount of carbon in the soil, which would help to offset greenhouse gas emissions and reverse climate change.

## Best Path Forward

The best path forward for the continued development and implementation of Managed Grazing to effectively mitigate the effects of climate change is to continue to support and fund research in this area so that the technology can be refined and improved. In addition, outreach and education efforts need to be scaled up so that more farmers and ranchers are aware of the benefits of Managed Grazing and are motivated to adopt these practices on their own land.

Some of the organizations that have been at the forefront of promoting Managed Grazing as a climate change mitigation strategy include the Environmental Defense Fund, the Natural Resources Conservation Service, and the Savory Institute. These organizations have helped to fund research on Managed Grazing, educate farmers and ranchers about the benefits of this practice, and provide technical assistance to those who want to implement it on their own land.

Progress has been made in recent years in terms of increasing the adoption of Managed Grazing practices. For example, the number of farmers and ranchers using managed grazing has increased from 2% in 2006 to 11% in 2016, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. In addition, a number of studies have shown that managed grazing can help to increase soil carbon sequestration, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and improve water quality.
