## Overview

- **Concentrated Solar Power (CSP):** Utilizes mirrors/lenses to focus sunlight, generating heat for electricity via turbines.
- **Breakthrough:** Heliostats (sun-tracking mirrors) enhance sunlight capture for more efficient energy generation.
- **Advances:** Enhanced solar collectors, heat storage using tanks for continuous power supply.
- **Leading Players:** SolarReserve, BrightSource Energy, Abengoa Solar pioneer large-scale CSP plants.

## Progress Made

- **Fresnel Mirrors:** Thinner, lighter mirrors concentrate solar radiation over larger areas, boosting efficiency.
- **Molten Salt Storage:** Molten salt stores solar energy for up to 12 hours, enabling power generation during non-sunny periods.
- **Leading Innovators:** SolarReserve's molten salt storage, Abengoa Solar's global power plants, U.S. Department of Energy funding research.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Early Stage Challenges:** Energy storage during non-sunny times remains a significant challenge.
2. **Mixed Results:** Failures alongside successes like SolarReserve's 10-hour energy storage plant.
3. **Importance of R&D:** Not investing early enough in research and development has hindered progress.
4. **Future Focus:** Energy storage solutions are pivotal for making CSP effective for climate change reversal.

## Challenges Ahead

- **High Initial Costs:** CSP plant construction requires substantial initial investment.
- **Large Land Areas:** CSP plants need extensive land, posing a challenge in land-scarce regions.
- **Sunlight Requirement:** Efficiency relies on abundant sunlight, posing issues in areas with limited sun.
- **Water Requirement:** Cooling needs water, which can be problematic in water-scarce areas.
- **Energy Storage:** Storing generated energy for non-sunny periods remains a technical challenge.

## Best Path Forward

- **Increase Awareness:** Educate the public about CSP's potential in climate mitigation.
- **Financial Incentives:** Offer incentives to encourage investment in CSP technology.
- **Collaborate with Utilities:** Integrate CSP into the grid in partnership with utility companies.
- **New CSP Plants:** Support the development of new CSP plants.
- **Leading Initiatives:** Solar Energy Industries Association, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, BrightSource Energy driving progress.
