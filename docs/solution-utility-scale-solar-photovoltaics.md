**Utility-Scale Solar Photovoltaics (PV)** refers to large-scale solar power generation that involves the installation of solar panels in significant quantities to produce electricity for utility grids. This approach stands as a crucial tool in the battle against climate change. By harnessing sunlight and converting it into electricity, utility-scale solar PV can generate substantial energy capacities that contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The deployment of utility-scale solar PV has witnessed remarkable growth, both in the United States and globally. It encompasses installations with capacities ranging from several megawatts (MW) to gigawatts (GW), making it a potent solution to meet the energy demands of homes, businesses, and industries. The success of utility-scale solar PV is underpinned by factors such as declining costs, supportive government incentives, and advancements in photovoltaic technology.

## Progress Made

Significant advancements have been made in utility-scale solar PV technology:

1. **Thin-Film Solar Cells**: Utilizing materials like cadmium telluride (CdTe), copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), and amorphous silicon (a-Si). These cells are thinner and can be produced on various substrates, offering cost-effectiveness and adaptability.
2. **Solar Concentrators**: Devices focusing sunlight to amplify electricity conversion. Concentrating photovoltaic (CPV) systems enhance solar cell efficiency. Solar thermal systems utilize concentrators to heat fluids for power or space heating/cooling.
