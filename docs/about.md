# About Us

![Cover Image](../static/img/offshore-wind-farm.jpg)

The climate tech movement is **exploding**.

Every day there is news about which technologies are succeeding, which are failing, and the best ways to make an impact.


## Our Mission

To build the world's most **accessible**, yet **comprehensive**, resource for anyone who wants to work on technology that will solve our climate emergency.


## Our Vision

### Climate tech is the new American Dream.

Instead of working for a boring tech company, or even worse, starting one...we want to inspire people to solve humanity's biggest challenge.

And still bring home a solid living that a tech career provides.

_Here is an example happy hour in Seattle. They're full of optimistic people working on climate, investing in climate, and starting climate tech companies._

### What does this look like?

The Climate Tech Handbook is here to pull together all the complicated information out there, and provide a free 100% open source guide for:

1. [Job seekers](intro) in Climate Tech

2. Startup funders, founders, and leaders


We value:

1) **Quality** [journalism](/contribute/#quality-journalism)

2) **Measurable** [impact](/contribute/#measurable-impact)

3) **Strong** [community](/contribute/#strong-community)



## Team

The Handbook was started by [Jacob Caggiano](https://jacobcaggiano.com).

We are made possible by our [Advisory Board](#advisory-board) and an active community of [Contributors](../contribute)
