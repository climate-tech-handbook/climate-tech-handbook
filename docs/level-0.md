## What is Climate Tech?

#### A broad definition:

Any form of technology that will help us implement our climate goals, particularly the 1.5C goal which requires:

- 50% emission reduction by 2030
- Net zero emissions by 2050.

#### The industry definition:

In the Silicon Valley style tech world, there is a movement toward investing in startups that are focused on a particular climate solution.

#### Climate tech vs Clean tech:
