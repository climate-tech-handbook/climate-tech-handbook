## Overview

* **Sustainable Intensification & Climate Change**: Since the early 2000s, the focus has been on sustainable intensification for smallholder farmers to curb greenhouse gas emissions.
* **Key Technologies**: Efficient irrigation systems, enhanced crop varieties, and effective soil management practices. These have resulted in improved yields and reduced water and fertilizer consumption.
* **Notable Organizations**: **International Rice Research Institute (IRRI)**, **World Wildlife Fund (WWF)**, **The Climate Corporation**, **Monsanto**, and **DuPont**.

## Progress Made

* **Technological Advancements**: Precision agriculture techniques have streamlined farming processes, minimizing greenhouse gas emissions.
* **Prominent Entities**: The Climate Corporation, Monsanto, and DuPont have significantly impacted sustainable intensification for smallholders.

## Lessons Learned

* **Land Management & Use**: Emphasis on selecting appropriate crops per region based on climatic and soil conditions.
* **Water Management**: Ensuring efficient irrigation, water conservation, and proper drainage mechanisms.
* **Nutrient Management**: Balancing fertilizer and manure application for enhanced yields.
* **Pest Management**: Strategically using pesticides while controlling pest infestations.
* **Energy Management**: Adoption of renewable energy and enhancing energy efficiency.
* **Global Efforts**: **World Bank** and **FAO** have backed the sustainable intensification initiative.
* **Successes & Failures**: While crop yields and soil health have improved, issues like over-reliance on pesticides persist.

## Challenges Ahead

* **Food Production**: Ensuring food production without excessive use of resources or environmental harm.
* **Farming Innovations**: Introducing eco-friendly and resource-efficient farming techniques.
* **Crop Diversity**: Ensuring diverse crops for better resilience against pests/diseases and improved nutrition.
* **Reducing Waste**: Efficient food storage and distribution systems.
* **Farmer Engagement**: Educating and involving smallholder farmers in sustainable methods.
* **Global Efforts**: **FAO** and the **World Bank** are pushing for the adoption of sustainable intensification practices.

## Best Path Forward

* **Raising Awareness**: Highlighting the benefits of sustainable intensification for smallholders.
* **Accessibility**: Making sustainable tools and techniques easily available.
* **Promoting Adoption**: Persuading smallholders to embrace sustainable methods.
* **Ongoing Monitoring**: Keeping track of the success rate and addressing shortcomings.
* **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly updating and refining techniques based on feedback and results.
* **Advocacy Leaders**: **World Bank** and **FAO** continue to be significant players in championing sustainable intensification for smallholders.
