Nitricity,Improved Manure Management,nan,"tensor(0.5100, device='mps:0')","Renewable on-site nitrogen fertilizer production Nitricity produces ready-to-use nitrogen with only air, water, and renewable electricity. Today, the global supply of fertilizer is fueled by coal and natural gas and travels through a complex supply chain to farms around the world. Fertilizer distribution is a hazardous and expensive process involving substantial storage and transportation infrastructure that stretches over thousands of miles. As a result, fertilizer costs are inflated and farmers are often forced to make decisions based on prices rather than plants. Furthermore, entrenched supply chains often miss developing economies, so nitrogen is not available where it is often needed most. Nitricity produces nitrogen fertilizer directly at the point of use. Our technology has the potential to produce cost-effective fertilizer for environmentally conscious farms, as well as for developing markets outside of traditional supply chain infrastructure.

Ocean-based climate solutions,Macroalgae Protection and Restoration,nan,"tensor(0.5344, device='mps:0')","We restore the ocean ecosystem while naturally sequestering CO2 in the deep ocean. Using endless free ocean waves as the energy source, our ""Oxygenator"" upwelling/downwelling pumps bring up nutrient-enriched water to the sunlit upper ocean, triggering blooms of phytoplankton (single-cell plants) which must absorb dissolved CO2 to metabolize the nutrients. Forming the base of the ocean food chain, phytoplankton are consumed by higher trophic species, with the carbon-rich detritus sinking by gravity with some converted into long-term “recalcitrant” CO2 by the microbial carbon pump. The downwelling pump amplifies the down-flow of high-CO2 water below 600m depth where it is isolated from the atmosphere for thousands of years. When scaled-up across the open oceans far from land, up to 1,800 gigatons can be naturally sequestered by 2100 using this technology, at a cost as low as $6.30 per ton. Funding will come from public corporations which gain strategic, financial, and marketing benefits by reaching net-negative CO2. Until now, these entities have freely emitted CO2 while providing products and services we all consume. The cost never was paid, so annual corporate earnings were overstated and accumulated on the corporation’s balance sheet. Our funding mechanism – Stock For Carbon – removes this excess valuation year-by-year as the corporation redresses its cumulative CO2 emissions and becomes cumulatively net-negative CO2. Not being paid in cash, the corporation maintains its working capital, preserving jobs, R&D, and growth.

ReFED has identified 27 of the best opportunities through the Roadmap to Reduce U.S. Food Waste, a first-of-its-kind economic analysis, making it easier for stakeholders across the food supply chain to meet the national 50% reduction goal by 2030. The ReFED Roadmap revolutionized the way the industry looks at food waste -- looking beyond challenges and identifying concrete opportunities to save money and resources, feed people, and create jobs. ReFED’s continued efforts include promoting date label standardization through a multi-stakeholder initiative; collecting data and generating insights on the innovation taking place to reduce food waste; and centralizing food waste policies at the state and Federal level.

Smart growth america,Walkable Cities,nan,"tensor(0.5343, device='mps:0')","Improving lives by improving communities “We envision a country where no matter where you live, or who you are, you can enjoy living in a place that is healthy, prosperous, and resilient.” --- Neighborhoods shape our lives. They are where we wake up each morning and go to work each day, where our children learn and grow, and where we spend time with our friends and family. Where we live can influence our health, our economic potential, and our children’s futures. Everyone in America—no matter his or her age, ability, income, or race—deserves the option to live somewhere affordable, convenient, beautiful, and safe. And America’s towns and cities deserve investment, stewardship, and supportive, thriving communities. A smart growth approach to development is about creating the places that make this possible. Smart growth means reinvesting in America’s downtowns and Main Streets, the economic engines of big cities and small towns alike. Smart growth means creating homes for families of all income levels alongside one another. Smart growth means diversifying our transportation system so Americans have a choice in how they get around. Smart growth means building streets that are safe for people walking, bicycling or using a wheelchair, as well as driving. Smart growth means reimagining the places we have already built, and protecting our open green spaces for generations to come. Above all, smart growth is about helping every town and city become a more economically prosperous, socially equitable, and environmentally sustainable place to live. This approach looks different for every community, but can help neighborhoods of any kind flourish, make towns and cities competitive in a 21st century economy, and improve lives by improving neighborhoods.","Urban design emphasizing pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, reducing the reliance on vehicles and promoting healthier, more sustainable transportation.",https://www.smartgrowthamerica.org
