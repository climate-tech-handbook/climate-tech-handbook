- By reducing worldwide cattle numbers, we can achieve immediate climate gains due to methane's short half-life. Additionally, industrial livestock reduction prevents destruction of biodiverse habitats that are ideal [land sinks](../sector-land-sinks).
- Beef is more [resource-intensive](https://www.wri.org/insights/6-pressing-questions-about-beef-and-climate-change-answered) than other meats, and animal-based foods require more resources than plant-based foods.
- Shifting towards plant-based diets offers the greatest potential for positive impact, surpassing increased yields, agricultural efficiency, and reduced food waste.

Food design technologies are revolutionizing plant-based options, enhancing taste and aroma. Advancements like extrudable fat technology, introducing new food resources, and climate-first supply chain technologies are transforming the way we eat. Embracing these innovations allows us to make sustainable choices for a healthier future.

Here are the [latest technology developments](https://gfi.org/science/the-science-of-plant-based-meat/):

* Lab-grown meat (CBM): Stem cells from animal biopsy are grown in bioreactors to form muscle, fat, and connective tissue for meat production.
* Plant- and fungi-based meat (PBM): Plant ingredients undergo sourcing, processing, and formulation stages to replace functional components in animal products through R&D.
* Recreate products have a low background flavor: The goal is to maintain a low background flavor in products without overpowering the subtler tastes of conventional meat or seafood.
