## Overview

1. Peatland Protection and Rewetting is a nature-based climate solution that focuses on preserving and restoring peatlands, which are wetlands that form on peat deposits. Peatlands store large amounts of carbon, estimated to be around 30% of the world's soil carbon. (Source: Project Drawdown)
2. Peatlands act as carbon sinks by absorbing and storing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through the process of peat formation. However, when drained or burned for agriculture or energy production, they release large amounts of carbon dioxide and methane, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. (Source: Project Drawdown)
3. Protecting and rewetting peatlands can help mitigate climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing carbon sequestration. Rewetting peatlands can prevent further degradation and promote peat growth, leading to increased carbon storage. (Source: Project Drawdown)
4. According to Project Drawdown, peatland protection and rewetting could reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by 11.2 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2050. (Source: Project Drawdown)
5. Peatland restoration can also provide co-benefits, such as improving water quality, reducing flood risk, and supporting biodiversity. (Source: Project Drawdown)

## Environmental Impact

Peatland Protection and Rewetting is a climate solution that focuses on preserving and restoring peatlands, which are wetlands that form on peat, a decomposed organic matter. Peatlands store large amounts of carbon and play a crucial role in mitigating climate change. Here are three key environmental impacts of Peatland Protection and Rewetting:

1. Carbon Sequestration: Peatlands are the world's largest terrestrial carbon sink, storing more than 30% of the world's soil carbon. Protecting and rewetting peatlands can help prevent the release of this carbon into the atmosphere through drainage or burning. According to Project Drawdown, Peatland Protection and Rewetting could sequester up to 11.9 gigatons of carbon dioxide by 2050.
2. Methane Emissions Reduction: Peatlands are also a significant source of methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas. Rewetting peatlands can help reduce methane emissions by up to 75%, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This can help mitigate the warming effect of methane and contribute to reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions.
3. Biodiversity Conservation: Peatlands are important habitats for many plant and animal species, including endangered ones. Protecting and restoring peatlands can help conserve biodiversity and promote ecosystem health. For example, according to Wetlands International, peatlands provide habitat for over 30% of all plant species and 20% of all animal species. Additionally, peatlands help filter water, reduce flood risk, and provide other ecosystem services.

Overall, Peatland Protection and Rewetting is an effective climate solution that can help mitigate climate change, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and conserve biodiversity. By protecting and restoring peatlands, we can help address multiple environmental challenges and promote a more sustainable future.

This project has prevented approximately 12.5 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent emissions and has helped to preserve the habitat for endangered species, such as the Sumatran tiger and the Sumatran orangutan.

## Policy Measures and Regulations

1. Peatland Protection Legislation: Governments can enact laws to prohibit or restrict peatland drainage, mining, and conversion for agriculture or other uses. For instance, in the European Union, the Natura 2000 network designates protected areas for peatlands, and member states are required to maintain or restore their ecological status.

2. Peatland Rewetting Programs: Governments can invest in programs to rewet peatlands, which involves reintroducing water to the land to restore its carbon storage capacity. In the UK, the Peatland Restoration Programme aims to restore 170,000 hectares of peatlands by 2050, focusing on areas with high carbon storage potential.

3. Financial Incentives: Governments can offer financial incentives to landowners and farmers to restore and maintain peatlands. For example, the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) provides payments for farmers who implement sustainable agriculture practices, including peatland restoration. In Indonesia, the Peatland Restoration Agency has launched a multi-stakeholder initiative to restore degraded peatlands, offering financial incentives to companies and communities.

4. Enforcement and Monitoring: Effective enforcement and monitoring are crucial for the success of peatland protection and rewetting initiatives. Governments can establish regulatory bodies and invest in satellite monitoring systems to detect illegal activities, such as drainage or mining, and enforce penalties for violations. For instance, in Canada, the Canadian Forest Service uses satellite imagery to monitor peatlands and detect changes in water levels, vegetation cover, and other indicators of ecosystem health.

For example, in Indonesia, the Rimba Raya Conservation Foundation has partnered with the government and private companies to develop a large-scale peatland restoration project, which aims to restore over 65,000 hectares of degraded peatlands and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

## Economic Benefits

Peatland Protection and Rewetting is a climate solution that involves preserving and restoring peatlands to prevent their drainage and degradation. Here are three to five economic benefits of implementing this solution:

1. Carbon Sequestration and Storage: Peatlands are the world's largest terrestrial carbon sink, storing more than 30% of the global soil carbon. By protecting and rewetting peatlands, we can prevent the release of carbon dioxide (CO2) through decomposition and oxidation. According to Project Drawdown, the economic value of carbon sequestration from peatland protection and rewetting is estimated to be $1.2 trillion over 30 years.
2. Mitigating Climate Change: Peatlands act as a natural buffer against climate change by absorbing and storing large amounts of CO2. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that the restoration of degraded peatlands could reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by 1.5 to 2.5 gigatons of CO2 equivalent per year. This could save up to $11.2 billion in climate change damages annually.
3. Water Resource Management: Peatlands act as natural water filters and storage systems. By protecting and rewetting peatlands, we can improve water quality and reduce the need for costly water treatment infrastructure. For example, in the Netherlands, the restoration of peatlands has resulted in an estimated annual economic benefit of €1.2 billion through reduced flood risk, improved water quality, and increased recreational opportunities.
4. Biodiversity Conservation: Peatlands are home to unique and diverse ecosystems that support a wide range of plant and animal species. By protecting and restoring peatlands, we can help preserve biodiversity and promote sustainable agriculture and forestry practices. According to the European Peatland Conservation Council, the economic value of ecosystem services provided by European peatlands is estimated to be €11 billion per year.
5. Energy Production: Peatlands can also be used as a source of renewable energy through sustainable peat harvesting and biomass energy production. This can provide economic opportunities for local communities and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. For example, in the UK, sustainable peat harvesting provides employment for over 1,000 people and generates £100 million in revenue annually. However, it is important to ensure that peat harvesting is done sustainably and does not compromise the carbon sequestration and storage benefits of peatlands.

## Challenges and Best Path Forward

### Challenges
1. Financial Constraints: Peatland protection and rewetting require significant upfront capital investments for acquisition of land, restoration projects, and maintenance costs. Sustainable financing mechanisms, such as carbon credits and public-private partnerships, are essential to overcome these financial challenges.
