## Overview

Recycling plays a crucial role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, conserving natural resources, and minimizing environmental impacts. Technologies such as pyrolysis, which breaks down organic matter into useful products without producing emissions, have been developed to recycle plastics and other materials into fuel, chemicals, and other useful products. Companies and organizations such as ExxonMobil and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have been at the forefront of developing and promoting recycling technologies.
