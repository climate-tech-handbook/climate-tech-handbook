## Overview

Landfill gas-to-energy (LFGE) facilities use landfill gas (LFG) – a mix of methane and carbon dioxide – to generate electricity or heat. This reduces greenhouse gas emissions by displacing fossil fuels and minimizing methane release. Recent advancements include more efficient destruction of methane and anaerobic digesters.

## Progress Made

* **Anaerobic Digestion**: Breaks down waste to produce methane for electricity.
* **Gas-to-Energy**: Converts methane to power homes and businesses.
* **Carbon Sequestration**: Captures methane for storage, preventing its release.

Organizations driving progress include the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Energy, and the Climate Change Mitigation Initiative.

## Lessons Learned

* **Effectiveness Depends on Factors**: Landfill size, waste type, and climate influence effectiveness.
* **Varied Success**: Projects have both succeeded and fallen short in emissions reduction.
* **Ongoing Development**: Various entities work on landfill methane capture, making progress.

## Challenges Ahead

* **Lack of Infrastructure**: Limited large-scale commercial facilities and early-stage technology.
* **International Standards Missing**: No regulations for landfill gas capture.
* **Investment Needed**: Funding required for research and implementation.

Entities leading the solution include the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Fund (CCMAF).

## Best Path Forward

* **Invest in R&D**: Improve technology and affordability through continued research.
* **Policy Changes**: Local, state, and federal policies to incentivize technology adoption.

Key organizations like the EPA in the United States and the CCEMC in Canada are driving research and development. Effective implementation is most feasible at new or expanding landfills.
