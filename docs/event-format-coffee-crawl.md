- An example route would be a one mile route, with 4 stops along the way

- Each stop would be one hour, so an example is Saturday from 10am-2pm, 4 stops at the top of every hour

- You post the route using a Google Maps link, [like this one](https://goo.gl/maps/jQ9nNTyNjBVRJwDf8).

If you get a lot of registrations and want to manage a large turnout, you can create a Slack Group or texting group to share live updates.

If a place gets too crowded, another place can be announced, or people can meet in a nearby park.



## 2. Create a Sharable Event
Use a tool such as [Luma](https://lu.ma) to craft a sharable event. Ensure the climate theme and any other goals or activities are clear.

## 3. Share the Event!
Utilize various marketing channels such as social media platforms, email newsletters, and your personal network to spread the word. Encourage others to share the event.

:::tip
In Seattle - we use the [Work on Climate Slack](workonclimate.org) and post in the #meet-seattle channel  
:::

## 4. Show Up
1. Beforehand, gather any required materials. Common materials are markers and name tags.

2. Arrive early on the event day to set up, address any last-minute concerns, and be ready to welcome attendees with organization and enthusiasm.

### Prize ideas

- Gift cards

- Organic apple cider and chocolates

:::info Remember
Take a big group photo!
:::

## 5. Share the Results!
After the event, utilize social media to share the highlights with those who attended and those who missed out. Sharing the results not only celebrates the success of the event but also encourages future engagement and participation.
