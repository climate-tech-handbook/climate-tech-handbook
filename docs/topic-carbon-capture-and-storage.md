## Understanding the Carbon Capture Industry:

* Methods of Carbon Capture: Pre-combustion, post-combustion, and oxy-fuel combustion.
* Storage & Utilization: Geological storage, mineralization, and utilization in products or chemical processes.


## Required Background & Experience:

* Technical Roles: Degrees in environmental engineering, chemical engineering, geology, or related fields.
* Policy & Management: Degrees in environmental policy, business administration, or related areas.
* Research: Advanced degrees in environmental science, carbon capture technologies, or related specializations.

## Where to Start:

* Internships: CCS-focused companies, environmental NGOs, and research institutions often offer internships.
* Networking: Join industry associations, attend environmental conferences, and connect with professionals in the sector.
* Entry-level Positions: Consider roles in research labs, CCS technology companies, or environmental consultancies.
