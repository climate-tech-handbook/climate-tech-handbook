## Overview

Biomass power converts organic materials such as agricultural waste, wood chips, and other biomass into electricity and heat through various processes. This renewable energy source helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provides a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels.

## Progress Made

Significant strides have been made in developing biomass power over the last decade to combat climate change. Innovations include technologies like pyrolysis, gasification, anaerobic digestion, combustion, and pyrolysis-combustion, all contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

1. **Breakthrough Technologies**: Development of cellulosic ethanol and algae-based biofuels.
2. **Prominent Supporters**: Organizations like the US Department of Energy, the US Environmental Protection Agency, and the International Renewable Energy Agency.

## Solutions by Sector
