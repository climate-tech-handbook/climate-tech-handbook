## Overview

Biochar retains most of the carbon produced by decomposing biomass.

Significant progress has been made toward efficient biochar production methods, carbon capture and storage, and emission-reducing agricultural practices. Organizations like the Biochar Industry Consortium, International Biochar Initiative, Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum, and Climate Change Mitigation Initiative have been at the forefront of this solution.

## Progress Made

- Low-emission biochar kilns using renewable energy sources have revolutionized biochar production.
- Techniques for rapid production and utilization of agricultural waste as feedstock have enabled large-scale, environmentally friendly biochar production.
- Companies leading the way in biochar production include CarbonCure Technologies, Blue Planet Ltd, and International Biochar Initiative.

## Lessons Learned

- Biochar production requires renewable energy sources and accounting for greenhouse gas emissions.
- Matching biochar type with soil and crop needs is essential for improving fertility and yields.
- Ensuring uncontaminated biochar is crucial when using it for air and water pollutant adsorption.
- International Biochar Initiative (IBI) and Biochar Solutions Initiative (BSI) are prominent organizations promoting biochar's use.

## Challenges Ahead

- Lack of standardized biochar definition hampers comparison and reliable impact assessment.
- Limited data on long-term soil and plant effects, as well as potential environmental contamination.
- Insufficient infrastructure and technical expertise hinder scalability and dissemination.
- Overcoming these challenges requires research, development, stakeholder involvement, and effective regulation.

## Best Path Forward

- Continued investment in research and development to enhance technology affordability.
- Raising awareness among the public and policymakers about biochar benefits.
- Encouraging government and business investment in biochar projects.
- Establishing standards, certification programs, and incentives for adoption.
- Key organizations leading the way include International Biochar Initiative, Biochar Solutions Initiative, and Biochar Fund.
