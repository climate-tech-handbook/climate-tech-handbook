# Reduced Food Waste

Reducing food waste is the NUMBER ONE recommended climate solution from Project Drawdown.

The total [emissions from the food system rise to ~34%](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-021-00225-9) when considering emissions associated with food waste rotting in landfills plus cooking, refrigerating, processing, transporting, and packaging food. That makes food the single largest emitting economic sector – larger than power generation, industry, transportation, or buildings.

- Globally, about one-third of all food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted, amounting to approximately 1.3 billion tonnes per year ([FAO](http://www.fao.org/food-loss-and-food-waste/en/)).
- Food waste contributes to roughly 8-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions ([UNEP Food Waste Index Report 2021](https://www.unep.org/resources/report/unep-food-waste-index-report-2021)).
- In the United States alone, families discard food worth about $1,500 annually ([Natural Resources Defense Council](https://www.nrdc.org/resources/wasted-how-america-losing-40-percent-its-food-farm-fork-landfill)).

## Environmental Impact

- If food waste were a country, it would be the third-largest greenhouse gas emitter after China and the United States ([FAO](http://www.fao.org/food-loss-and-food-waste/en/)).
- Food waste in landfills produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas with 25 times the global warming potential of CO2 ([EPA](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases)).
- Wasted food also represents a significant loss of water, land, and energy resources used in production.
