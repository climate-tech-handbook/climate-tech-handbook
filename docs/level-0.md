## Lesson Start

![test](../static/img/welcome-aboard.jpg) 

Congratulations! You took the first step.

:::note Lesson 1
### In this lesson:
- What is "climate tech"
- Intro to Climate Solution frameworks
- What a climate job is like
- Intro to core communities and resources
:::

## What is Climate Tech?

#### A broad definition:

Any form of technology that will help us implement our climate goals, particularly the 1.5C goal which requires:

- 50% emission reduction by 2030
- Net zero emissions by 2050.

#### The industry definition:

In the Silicon Valley style tech world, there is a movement toward investing in startups that are focused on a particular climate solution.

#### Climate tech vs Clean tech:

First - **fixing climate is a subset** within a broader circle of clean technologies. For example, water pollution, plastic pollution, or e-waste do not cause greenhouse emissions. However, they are still a critical problem affecting environmental health, justice, and the biodiversity crisis.

Second - **clean tech has an association** with a green startup period during the Obama administraton. Experiments from that time didn't quite turn out as expected. <!--link--> Climate tech is a version 2.0 [renaissance] for the 2020s.

## What is a climate job like?

:::question Frequently Asked Questions
- How well does it pay?
- How do I learn the necessary skills?
- How secure are these jobs?
- How do I avoid greenwashing?
:::


### How well does it pay?

#### Early stage startups:

- Climate tech companies focusing on a specific climate [solution](solutions) tend to be early stage startups.
- Early stage startups are more likely to pay lower salaries in exchange for generous equity packages.
- That said, climate startups want to attract quality talent and understand that competitive pay is important.


#### Established companies:

- You can try to change the direction of a bigger company
- Project Drawdown has a [guide on this topic](park)
- Companies like Microsoft, Google, Stripe, etc. have a specific corporate sustainbility positions. There are also many consultancies.
- Think outside the box. For example, you are in procurement, you have a huge opportunity to order supplies that come from clean sources. Start a green team that doesn't exist in your current job


#### Government Jobs

- There are plenty of government jobs <!--governmentjobs.com example urls-->
- The salaries are lower, but some states and counties <!--munis??--> offer good health care and pensions
- There can be a higher level of job security, predictability, and transparency compared to a fast moving startup environment.

###  How do I learn the necessary skills?

There are two aspects:

1. **Marketable skills**
2. **Domain knowledge**

:::note Marketable skills
#### If you already have marketable skills and tech experience

There are plenty of jobs that have the same roles as a non-climate tech company

:::


:::info Experience gap
#### If you are new to tech without 3+ years of experience

[You can contribute](contribute) to the Handbook as an open source project to gain experience quickly
