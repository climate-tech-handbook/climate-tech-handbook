If you already know the [definitions](#definition-of-level-1-and-level-2) of all 3 levels and are not struggling with [tech experience or specialized skill challenges](we-are-almost-ready-to-start-the-lesson-for-level-0-but-first)().

**Skip below to start the lesson** 👇.

Otherwise please read the Important Criteria.

## Important Criteria

#### Definition of LEVEL 1 and LEVEL 2

#### LEVEL 1 means

<!-- insert link to definition of 1.5C, net zero, and 2050-->

* Your job search isn't going great and you are feeling "imposter syndrome"

* You aren't sure which general sector or specific [climate solution](solutions) you want to focus on yet

#### We are almost ready to [start the lesson](#lesson-start) for LEVEL 0 but first:

:::caution Important note for those who are struggling with specialized experience.

The tech world is a bit like Hollywood.

It's extremely competitive with millions of people clamoring to get a piece of the 🇺🇸 American Dream™.

You may feel frustrated and ready to give up.

Every job description wants a minimum of 3-5 years of specialized experience that you don't have.

**This problem is especially rampant in climate tech**.

Climate tech is a world of high risk early startups with founders and hiring managers who are under pressure to draft the best possible "talent" into the climate arena.

### 😩 We feel your pain and are here to help

#### If you want to shrink 3 years of requred experience down to 3 months building a real world portfolio.

The Climate Tech Handbook is completely [open source](contribute).

You can join us on Slack and prove to the world that you're ready.
