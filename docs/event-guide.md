:::

### Interactive Q&A

Someone announces a question they have, for example, something about their job search.

- Everyone who has the same question, moves to form a single "QUESTION LINE". 

- Everyone who has an answer to share, moves to a second "ANSWER LINE" directly across the QUESTION LINE.

- People from the ANSWER LINE take turns sharing their insightful answers to the QUESTION LINE

### The Wind Blows

This is designed for like-minded people to figure out who they want to connect with.

- People take turns saying "The Wind Blows For _______" (then fill in the blank with something 
about your identity).

- For example: "The Wind Blows for the built environment" or "The Wind Blows for alternatives to 
meat" or "The Wind Blows for forest tech"

### Spectrum

This is designed to spark conversation from a diverse set of perspectives.

- The group designates a "spectrum" line that goes from one side of the room to the other

- People will be standing on various points of the line, depending on their opinion about a certain topic

- On one end of the line, you have the "Completely Agree" section, and on the opposite end, the "Completely Disagree" section.

- Someone reads out an opinion statement and allows a few seconds for everyone to walk along the spectrum and stand where they feel best represents their own personal view

An example opinion statement would be: "**selling carbon credits on the free market is the best way to incentivize emission reductions, compared to regulation like a carbon tax**"

People then can share their view and elaborate on why they feel that way, based on where they stand along the spectrum.
