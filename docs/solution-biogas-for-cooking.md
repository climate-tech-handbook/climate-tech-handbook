## Overview

- **Biogas**: Produced from the breakdown of organic matter like food waste, manure, and sewage through anaerobic digestion.
- **Application**: Used for cooking, heating, and powering vehicles.
- **Greenhouse Gas Reduction**: Replaces traditional fuels, leading to fewer greenhouse gas emissions.
- **Leaders in Biogas Promotion**: Biogas industry, United Nations, World Bank.

## Progress Made

Significant advancements in biogas technology have led to reduced greenhouse gas emissions and increased adoption of biogas systems:

A new method can convert 95 percent of biogas into [green fuel methanol](https://www.technology.org/2024/05/28/gas-strategy-fuels-concerns-about-the-cost-of-energy/) without adding hydrogen, making green methanol much cheaper to produce than before.
