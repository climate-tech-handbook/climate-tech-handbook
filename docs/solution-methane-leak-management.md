## Solutions by Sector

### Oil and Gas
- **Well Pad Monitoring**: Continuous methane monitoring systems for oil and gas well pads.
- **Pipeline Leak Detection**: Mobile leak detection systems for natural gas pipelines.
- **Compressor Station Surveys**: Regular methane surveys at natural gas compressor stations.

**Case Studies:**
1. **ExxonMobil's Methane Leak Detection Program**: ExxonMobil claims to have implemented comprehensive methane monitoring across its operations. However, a study by the Environmental Defense Fund found that the company's reported methane emissions were likely significantly underestimated [Environmental Defense Fund](https://www.edf.org/media/new-study-finds-us-oil-and-gas-methane-emissions-are-60-percent-higher-epa-reports-0).

2. **Chevron's Methane Management**: Chevron reports using advanced technologies to detect and repair methane leaks. Yet, a 2021 report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) suggests that the oil and gas industry overall needs to do much more to reduce methane emissions to meet climate goals [IEA Methane Tracker 2021](https://www.iea.org/reports/methane-tracker-2021).

3. **BP's Drone Program**: BP claims to use drones for methane leak detection in its operations. While this technology shows promise, a study published in Nature Communications indicates that current industry efforts are insufficient to meet Paris Agreement targets [Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25017-4).

### Landfills
- **Surface Emissions Monitoring**: Regular surveys of landfill surfaces for methane emissions.
- **Gas Collection Systems**: Installation and optimization of landfill gas collection systems.
- **Biocover Systems**: Use of biocovers to oxidize methane emissions from landfills.

**Case Studies:**
1. **Waste Management's Landfill Gas-to-Energy Program**: Waste Management reports converting landfill methane to electricity. However, the EPA's Landfill Methane Outreach Program suggests that many landfills still have untapped potential for methane capture and use [EPA LMOP](https://www.epa.gov/lmop).

2. **Republic Services' Methane Capture**: Republic Services claims to implement advanced methane capture technologies in landfills. A report by the Global Methane Initiative indicates that while progress has been made, significant opportunities remain for improving methane capture in the waste sector globally [Global Methane Initiative](https://www.globalmethane.org/documents/gmi-mitigation-factsheet.pdf).

3. **SUEZ's BioMethane Production**: SUEZ reports converting landfill gas to renewable natural gas. While this is a positive step, research published in Waste Management journal suggests that optimizing landfill operations could further reduce methane emissions [Waste Management Journal](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956053X20301167).

### Agriculture
- **Manure Management**: Implementation of anaerobic digesters for livestock manure.
- **Rice Cultivation**: Alternate wetting and drying techniques to reduce methane emissions.
- **Enteric Fermentation**: Feed additives to reduce methane emissions from livestock.

**Case Studies:**
1. **California Bioenergy's Dairy Digesters**: California Bioenergy installs digesters on dairy farms to capture methane. While this technology is promising, a report by the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy suggests that large-scale dairy operations still contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions [IATP Report](https://www.iatp.org/documents/milking-planet).

2. **Arla Foods' Climate Check Program**: Arla Foods implements methane reduction strategies on dairy farms. However, a study in the Journal of Dairy Science indicates that more comprehensive approaches are needed to significantly reduce dairy's carbon footprint [Journal of Dairy Science](https://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022-0302(19)30761-7/fulltext).

3. **Tyson Foods' Manure-to-Energy Projects**: Tyson Foods converts livestock manure to energy. While this is a step in the right direction, research published in Environmental Science & Technology suggests that addressing methane emissions from enteric fermentation remains a significant challenge in livestock agriculture [Environmental Science & Technology](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.0c06811).
