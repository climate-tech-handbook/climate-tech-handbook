## STEP ONE: Pick a Venue

Make a list of potential venues.

Consider
- **Size** (not to small)

- **Location** (easy to get to)

- **Amenities** (food and drinks, chairs for the audience)

As your list of venues grow, **Share It** for future reference with other organizers.


### Special Considerations

- Audio amplification

- Food service

- Chairs for the audience


The best way to handle these special considerations, particularly catering service, is to **find a sponsor**.

### How to find a sponsor

- Make a list of climate tech companies in your area. Go to [climatetechlist.com](https://climatetechlist.com) or [climatebase.org](https://climatebase.org) and filter by location.

- Find connections on LinkedIn, ask for intros to get in the door. You can try messaging someone who works there on the [Work on Climate Slack Community](https://workonclimate.org).

- Make your pitch in the company's interest by giving thanking them and allowing them to announce something before the panel starts.

Catering ideas can be something simple like bahn mi sandwichies (include vegetarian options).

### How to find Experts

- It's a similar process to the sponsorship advice above

- Your experts could also get their organization to sponsor

- Consider diversity - your panel should have various backgrounds, perspectives, and not be entirely men.

## STEP TWO: Create a Sharable Event
Use a tool such as [Luma](https://lu.ma) to craft a sharable event. Ensure the climate theme and any other goals or activities are clear.

## STEP THREE: Share the Event!
Utilize various marketing channels such as social media platforms, email newsletters, and your personal network to spread the word. Encourage others to share the event.

## STEP FOUR: Show Up
1. Beforehand, gather any required materials. Common materials are markers and name tags.

2. Arrive early on the event day to set up, address any last-minute concerns, and be ready to welcome attendees with organization and enthusiasm.

## STEP FIVE: Share the Results!
After the event, utilize social media to share the highlights with those who attended and those who missed out. Sharing the results not only celebrates the success of the event but also encourages future engagement and participation.
