# Climate Solutions

## Good news!

We already have the science and technology needed to win this critical decade.

But we need to move extremely fast.

:::info What is Project Drawdown?
The Handbook is based off of the [Project Drawdown](https://drawdown.org/solutions/table-of-solutions) solutions framework.

Below is a list of all 93 Drawdown Solutions organized by sector.

Each solution comes with a calculated number of greenhouse emissions that need to be reduced each year to stay below 2C average temperature.
