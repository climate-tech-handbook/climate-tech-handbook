## Overview

**Nuclear power** stands out as a clean and efficient means of generating electricity, free from greenhouse gas emissions. Recent strides in technology, such as **small modular reactors (SMRs)**, have yielded more cost-effective and environmentally friendly options. Operating nuclear plants have curtailed over 2.5 billion metric tons of CO2 emissions, akin to taking 500 million cars off the road. Globally, over 450 reactors supply about 10% of electricity.

Forefront organizations include the **U.S. Department of Energy**, the **Nuclear Regulatory Commission**, and the **World Nuclear Association**.

## Progress Made

- **New nuclear technologies** like SMRs and thorium-based reactors have surfaced, reducing emissions and waste.
- Organizations like the **World Nuclear Association** and the **International Atomic Energy Agency** lead in nuclear power's development.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Successes**:
   - Nuclear power plants release no greenhouse gases and prevent millions of tons of CO2 emissions.
   - Nuclear energy produces more electricity than any other emission-free source.
   - It already supplies around 11% of global electricity, aiding climate goals.
2. **Failures**:
   - High costs, maintenance expenses, and decommissioning challenges hinder nuclear expansion.
   - Accidents like Fukushima highlight nuclear hazards and environmental risks.
   - Long-lasting, **radioactive nuclear waste** remains a pressing issue.
3. **Lessons Learned**:
   - Nuclear power offers low-carbon energy but requires careful handling.
   - Cost, safety, and waste issues need to be addressed.

## Challenges Ahead

- **Cost** remains high compared to natural gas, coal, and renewables.
- **Safety** concerns and potential nuclear accidents pose significant risks.
- Handling **nuclear waste** safely and responsibly is an ongoing challenge.
- **Proliferation** risks must be managed as more countries adopt nuclear technology.

Despite challenges, nuclear power remains a promising solution to climate change. To achieve widespread adoption, costs must decrease, safety concerns must be mitigated, and waste management must be addressed.

## Best Path Forward

Continued progress in nuclear power to combat climate change involves:

1. Investing in **research and development** for enhanced safety and efficiency.
2. Building **supportive infrastructure** including training, regulation, and public approval.

Entities like the **U.S. Department of Energy**, the **Electric Power Research Institute**, and **NuScale Power** play a vital role in nuclear power's development.
