## Overview

Green and cool roofs are a type of low-impact development that can be used to mitigate the urban heat island effect and reduce energy consumption. Green roofs are vegetated with plants, while cool roofs are coated with a white or light-colored material to reflect sunlight. Both types of roofs can help reduce the amount of heat that is absorbed by buildings, which can reduce the need for air conditioning and save energy.

Organizations such as the Green Roofs for Healthy Cities have been at the forefront of promoting green and cool roofs as a way to reduce the urban heat island effect and improve energy efficiency. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency's ENERGY STAR program has also recognized the potential of green and cool roofs and has developed a rating system for cool roofs.

Some of the breakthrough technologies that have been developed for green and cool roofs include:

- Green roofs that are designed to mimic natural ecosystems and provide habitat for local wildlife
- Living walls that are covered with vegetation and can help improve air quality
- Solar panels that can be integrated into green roofs to generate renewable energy
- Cool roofs that are made with reflective materials that can reduce the amount of heat absorbed by a building

These technologies have contributed to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by helping to improve the energy efficiency of buildings.

## Progress Made

Green roofs and cool roofs are two solutions that have been developed to help reverse climate change. Green roofs are vegetated roofs that help to insulate a building and reduce the amount of heat that is absorbed by the building. Cool roofs are roofs that reflect sunlight and heat away from the building, helping to keep the building cooler.

Some breakthrough technologies that have been developed for green roofs include modular green roofs and living roofs. Modular green roofs are pre-vegetated green roofs that can be easily installed on a building. Living roofs are green roofs that have a layer of soil and vegetation that is alive and growing.

Some companies and organizations that have been at the forefront of developing green roofs include Green Roofs for Healthy Cities, the Green Roof Infrastructure Services group, and the Living Roof Company.

## Lessons Learned

Some of the key lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of Green and Cool Roofs to reverse climate change are as follows:

1. Green and cool roofs can help to mitigate the urban heat island effect, which can reduce cooling energy requirements for buildings by up to 20-40%.

2. Green and cool roofs can also help to reduce stormwater runoff, which can reduce the strain on local sewer systems and reduce flooding risks.

3. Green and cool roofs can also improve air quality by trapping particulate matter and providing a green space for urban dwellers.

4. Implementing green and cool roofs can be challenging, and it is important to consider factors such as building code requirements, cost, and maintenance when planning a project.

5. There are a number of companies and organizations that are at the forefront of green and cool roof technology, including the International Green Roof Association, the Cool Roof Rating Council, and the Green Roofs for Healthy Cities.

## Challenges Ahead

The International Energy Agency estimates that the world needs to install an additional 3.8 million square kilometers (1.48 million square miles) of rooftop solar photovoltaics (PV) and 1.6 million square kilometers (617,763 square miles) of concentrated solar power (CSP) by 2050 to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. That’s more than 10 times the solar PV capacity that existed in 2015.

The agency’s report, Solar Heating and Cooling for Buildings, says that solar thermal technologies could provide 11% of the world’s final energy demand for heating and cooling by 2050. Solar thermal systems use the sun’s energy to heat water or air, which is then used for space heating, domestic hot water, or to power absorption chilling systems that can provide both space cooling and heat.

The IEA says that the world’s solar thermal market is currently worth around $6 billion per year and could grow to $160 billion per year by 2050. The majority of the growth will come from the residential sector as solar thermal becomes increasingly cost-competitive with other heating technologies.

In order for solar thermal to play a significant role in meeting global energy demand, a number of challenges need to be overcome.

First, the technology needs to become more efficient. Solar thermal systems currently have an average efficiency of around 20-30%, meaning that only a fifth to a third of the sun’s energy is converted into useful heat. This needs to increase to around 50% if solar thermal is to become a major player in the global energy mix.

Second, the costs of solar thermal need to come down. The IEA estimates that the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) for solar thermal is currently around double that of solar PV. This needs to be reduced to around $0.05 per kilowatt-hour if solar thermal is to be competitive with other technologies.

Third, the solar thermal industry needs to increase its installed capacity. The IEA estimates that the world currently has around 200 gigawatts (GW) of installed solar thermal capacity. This needs to increase to around 4,000 GW by 2050 to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.

Finally, the solar thermal industry needs to increase its share of the global heating and cooling market. The IEA estimates that solar thermal currently has a 2% share of the global heating and cooling market. This needs to increase to 11% by 2050 if solar thermal is to play a significant role in meeting global energy demand.

A number of companies and organizations are at the forefront of the solar thermal industry. These include the Solar Heating and Cooling Programme of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the Solar Thermal World Council (STWC), and the International Solar Energy Society (ISES).

## Best Path Forward

The continued development and implementation of Green and Cool Roofs is critical to mitigating the effects of climate change. To ensure that this technology is adopted on a large scale and is effective, a number of steps need to be taken. First, it is important to continue to educate the public about the benefits of Green and Cool Roofs. Second, it is necessary to provide incentives for individuals and businesses to install Green and Cool Roofs. Finally, it is essential to ensure that the technology is continuously improved.

A number of companies and organizations have been at the forefront of the Green and Cool Roofs movement. For example, the Cool Roof Rating Council (CRRC) is a nonprofit organization that provides leadership and incentives for the development and implementation of energy-efficient cool roofs. The CRRC has developed a rating system that allows consumers to compare the energy-saving potential of different cool roof products. In addition, the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) is a nonprofit organization that promotes sustainable building practices, including the use of Green and Cool Roofs. The USGBC provides education and training to architects, engineers, and other professionals, and it offers a variety of resources, including LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification, which recognizes buildings that meet certain energy-efficiency and sustainability standards.

A number of cities and states have also been leaders in the adoption of Green and Cool Roofs. For example, San Francisco has a mandatory Green Roofs Ordinance, which requires that all new commercial and residential buildings with roofs larger than 2,500 square feet install a green roof. In addition, Chicago has a Cool Roofs Initiative, which provides incentives for businesses and homeowners to install cool roofs. And, in New York City, a citywide Cool Roofs Law was passed in 2009, mandating that all city-owned buildings greater than 25,000 square feet install cool roofs.

The adoption of Green and Cool Roofs has been growing in recent years, due in part to the increasing awareness of the need to mitigate the effects of climate change. In addition, the availability of incentives and the continuous improvement of the technology have also contributed to the growing popularity of Green and Cool Roofs.
