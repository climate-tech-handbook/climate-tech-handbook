What is algae
Algae is a catch-all category of photosynthetic aquatic organisms, some of which are very distantly related to land plants.  Algae can be further categorized into four sub-groups:

## Green Algae

Multicellular or unicellular bodies.  Land plants are derived from a member of this group.  Green algae exist globally in marine, freshwater, terrestrial locations with high humidity, and in symbiotic relations.

USAGE: food


## Red Algae
Multicellular living in marine environments.  Freshwater red algae are rare.  Red Algae typically thrive in deeper depths than other algae and despite being called "Red Algae" their coloration ranges from purple to bright pink, sometimes black or green.  This group includes many of the worlds seedweeds.

USAGE: food, thickeners


## Brown Algae (Kelp)
Multicellular bodies with leaf-like structures.  These algae only live in marine environments typically in cooler climates, and includes many of the worlds seaweeds.  Coloration ranges from dull-green to shades of brown.  Brown algaes often have a "holdfast", a cup-like structure that allows them to anchor to rocks.

USAGE: food, thickener, carbon dioxide sink, medicine


## Blue-Green Algae (Cyanobacteria)
Not considered true algae since they are photosynthetic bacteria.  These bacteria exist globally and can be found in marine, freshwater, and any terrestrial locations with high humidity.  They can exist as unicelluar organisms or colonies.
USAGE: food, bioethanol, agriculture, soil remediation, electricity production, medicinal potential, terraforming potential

Because Algae is a collective of relatively unrelated organisms, their propagation and uses vary significantly.  For this reason, usage categories are discussed further adressing each relavant algal lineage.
