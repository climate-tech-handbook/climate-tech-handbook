## Overview

* **Peatland Protection and Rewetting**: Restores wetlands and prevents further degradation.
* **Climate change mitigation**: Reduces greenhouse gas emissions from peat decomposition.
* Key technologies:

  * **Peatland restoration**: Reviving degraded peatlands.
  * **Peatland management**: Preventing further degradation.
  * **Peatland monitoring**: Tracking condition and threats.
* Major contributors: **Global Peatland Initiative**, **International Peatland Society**, **Nature Conservancy**.

## Progress Made

* **Peatland protection and rewetting**: Restores and conserves degraded wetlands, reduces emissions.
* Technologies include:

  * **Peatland mapping**: Identifies areas needing protection/restoration.
  * **Drainage control**: Minimizes water drainage from wetlands.
  * **Restoration**: Re-establishes vegetation in degraded wetlands.
* Leading entities: **The Nature Conservancy**, **Wetlands International**, **Global Peatland Initiative**.

## Lessons Learned

* **Prevention**: It's crucial to prevent peatland degradation initially.
* **Greenhouse gas release**: Degradation releases significant greenhouse gases.
* **Restoration challenges**: Preventing degradation is tough; restoration is slow, expensive, and not always successful.
* **Importance of peatlands**: Vital tools for mitigating climate change due to carbon storage.

## Challenges Ahead

* **Awareness deficit**: Need for broader understanding of peatlands in the global carbon cycle.
* **Funding scarcity**: Lack of resources for conservation and restoration projects.
* **Research requirement**: Effective methods and long-term monitoring for peatland protection/restoration.
* Key organizations: **IUCN**, **GEF**, **UNEP**.

## Best Path Forward

* **Large-scale adoption**: Peatland protection and rewetting essential for combating climate change.
* Effective measures include:

  * Boosting **awareness**.
  * Enhancing **research** for improved protection and rewetting methodologies.
  * Collaborating with **governments** for supportive policies.
  * Offering **financial incentives** for peatland conservation.
  * **Monitoring and evaluation** of ongoing efforts.
* Frontline entities: **IUCN**, **UNEP**, **Wetlands International**.
