## Overview

Aquaculture is the farming of fish, shellfish, and other aquatic animals. It is a rapidly growing industry that provides a significant source of food for people around the world. Aquaculture also has the potential to help reverse climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Over the past two decades, the global aquaculture industry has increased its focus on sustainability, according to a [recent review](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03308-6#Sec3) published in Nature. Aquaculture production can help feed the world’s growing population by providing an important source of protein. And as overfishing of oceans continues to increase, the world must find alternate sources of seafood to meet demand.

The Aquaculture Innovation Challenge is a competition sponsored by the WWF and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. The challenge provides funding for innovative projects that improve the sustainability of aquaculture.

The Global Aquaculture Alliance is another organization working to improve the sustainability of aquaculture. The Alliance promotes the adoption of best management practices and provides training and education resources for the aquaculture industry.

## Progress Made

Some examples of breakthrough technologies that have been developed to improve aquaculture and reduce greenhouse gas emissions include:

1. Aquaponics: This is a type of aquaculture where fish and plants are grown together in a symbiotic system. The fish waste provides nutrients for the plants, and the plants help to filter the water for the fish. This system is highly efficient and can be used to produce food and fish products with a reduced carbon footprint.
2. Recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS): These systems recycle and reuse water in aquaculture facilities, which reduces the need for fresh water and the discharge of wastewater. This can help to reduce the carbon footprint of aquaculture operations.
3. Offshore aquaculture: This type of aquaculture takes place in the open ocean, away from the coastline. This can help to reduce the impact of aquaculture on sensitive coastal ecosystems.

Some companies and organizations that have been at the forefront of developing improved aquaculture to reverse climate change include:

1. The Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC): The ASC is a nonprofit organization that promotes responsible aquaculture practices around the world.
2. The Global Aquaculture Alliance (GAA): The GAA is a trade association that represents the aquaculture industry.
3. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF): The WWF is a conservation organization that works to protect the world’s wildlife and ecosystems.

## Lessons Learned

Some of the key lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of Improved Aquaculture to reverse climate change are as follows:

1. It is important to have a clear and concise plan when developing aquaculture facilities. All stakeholders need to be on board with the plan in order to ensure its success.
2. It is crucial to monitor the water quality in aquaculture facilities on a regular basis. Water quality can have a direct impact on the health of the fish and other aquatic animals.
3. It is important to use quality feed in aquaculture facilities. The type of feed can have a direct impact on the growth and health of the fish.
4. It is important to properly manage waste in aquaculture facilities. Waste can pollute the water and affect the health of the fish.
5. It is important to use renewable energy sources in aquaculture facilities. This will help to reduce the carbon footprint of the facility.

Some of the companies and organizations that have been at the forefront of this solution are as follows:

1. Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC)
2. Global Aquaculture Alliance (GAA)
3. World Wildlife Fund (WWF)

## Challenges Ahead

One of the major challenges that remain in the development and implementation of Improved Aquaculture to reverse climate change is the need to overcome the obstacles to scale up and widely adopt this technology. One of the obstacles is the lack of awareness of the potential of this technology among the general public. Another obstacle is the lack of funding for research and development of this technology. A third obstacle is the lack of political will to support this technology.

One of the companies that have been at the forefront of this solution is AquaBounty Technologies. This company has developed a genetically engineered salmon that grows twice as fast as normal salmon. The company is working to commercialize this salmon and plans to sell it in the United States.

Despite the obstacles, there has been some progress in the development and implementation of Improved Aquaculture to reverse climate change. One example of this progress is the development of new technology that allows for the farming of fish in inland ponds. This technology has the potential to reduce the impact of aquaculture on the environment.

## Best Path Forward

There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the best path forward for the continued development and implementation of Improved Aquaculture will vary depending on the specific context and needs of each aquaculture operation. However, some general steps that need to be taken to ensure that this technology is adopted on a large scale and is effective include:

1. Increasing awareness of the benefits of Improved Aquaculture among aquaculture producers and other stakeholders.
2. Conducting more research to develop and optimize Improved Aquaculture technologies for different aquaculture production systems.
3. Providing financial incentives or subsidies to encourage aquaculture producers to adopt Improved Aquaculture technologies.
4. Establishing regulations or standards that require or encourage the use of Improved Aquaculture technologies in aquaculture operations.

Some companies and organizations that have been at the forefront of promoting and developing Improved Aquaculture technologies include the World Aquaculture Society, the Aquaculture Stewardship Council, and the Global Aquaculture Alliance.
