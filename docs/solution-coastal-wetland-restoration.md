## Overview

Some progress has been made in developing Coastal Wetland Restoration to reverse climate change. Breakthrough technologies that have been developed include:
* Green infrastructure: Green infrastructure is a term used to describe the use of vegetation, soils, and other natural systems to provide environmental services. Green infrastructure can be used to manage stormwater, reduce flooding, and improve water quality.
* Living shorelines: Living shorelines are a type of green infrastructure that uses natural materials to stabilize shorelines and reduce erosion.
* Wetland restoration: Wetland restoration is the process of creating or restoring a wetland to its natural state. This can be done by raising the water table, planting native vegetation, and creating or restoring hydrologic features.

Companies and organizations that have been at the forefront of this solution include:
* The Nature Conservancy
* The Wetlands Initiative
* The Environmental Defense Fund
* The National Wildlife Federation

## Progress Made

Progress has been made in developing Coastal Wetland Restoration to reverse climate change through the development of breakthrough technologies such as carbon capture and storage, green infrastructure, and wetlands restoration. These technologies have contributed to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by sequestering carbon, reducing energy consumption, and improving water quality. Companies and organizations such as the Nature Conservancy, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have been at the forefront of this solution.

## Lessons Learned

Some key lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of Coastal Wetland Restoration to reverse climate change include the importance of:

1. Proper site selection and characterization - In order to be successful, it is important to select sites that are suitable for wetland restoration and to thoroughly characterize the site in terms of its physical and chemical properties.

2. Use of native plant species - The use of native plant species is important for the success of wetland restoration projects. Non-native species can become invasive and cause problems for the local ecosystem.

3. Incorporation of natural processes - Incorporating natural processes, such as tidal flushing and sedimentation, into the design of restoration projects can help to ensure their success.

4. Monitoring and adaptive management - Monitoring of wetland restoration projects is important to assess their success and identify any problems that may arise. Adaptive management strategies can then be used to address any issues that are identified.

Some companies and organizations that have been at the forefront of coastal wetland restoration include the Environmental Protection Agency, the Army Corps of Engineers, and The Nature Conservancy.

## Challenges Ahead

There are a few major challenges that remain in the development and implementation of Coastal Wetland Restoration to reverse climate change. Firstly, the high cost of restoration projects is a significant obstacle to scaling up and widely adopting this technology. For example, a recent study found that the cost of restoring a typical 2.5-acre wetland in the Gulf Coast region of the United States would be approximately $48,000 USD (Gao et al., 2016). This is a significant amount of money, especially for smaller communities or organizations.

Another challenge is the lack of scientific data on the long-term efficacy of coastal wetland restoration projects. While there is some evidence that restored wetlands can provide ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and water filtration (Niering et al., 2001; Gao et al., 2016), there is still a need for more research to quantify the long-term benefits of these projects.

Finally, there is also a need for more public awareness and education on the benefits of coastal wetland restoration. While many people are aware of the importance of wetlands in general, there is still a lack of understanding of the role that restored wetlands can play in mitigating climate change.

Some companies and organizations that have been at the forefront of coastal wetland restoration include the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and The Nature Conservancy (TNC). These organizations have been involved in various restoration projects around the country and have been working to increase public awareness of the importance of wetlands.

## Best Path Forward

There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the best path forward for the continued development and implementation of coastal wetland restoration to effectively mitigate the effects of climate change will vary depending on the specific circumstances and needs of each individual case. However, some general steps that need to be taken in order to ensure the effective adoption and implementation of this technology on a large scale include:

1. Increasing awareness of the potential benefits of coastal wetland restoration as a climate change mitigation strategy among policy makers, planners, and the general public.

2. Conducting more research to improve our understanding of the most effective methods for coastal wetland restoration, and developing standardized protocols and guidelines that can be used by practitioners.

3. Providing financial incentives and other forms of support to encourage landowners and other stakeholders to implement coastal wetland restoration projects.

4. Monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of coastal wetland restoration projects, and sharing lessons learned with the wider community.

Some companies and organizations that have been at the forefront of coastal wetland restoration include The Nature Conservancy, the Environmental Defense Fund, and the National Wildlife Federation. Progress made in this area includes the restoration of over 3 million acres of coastal wetlands in the United States since the early 1990s.
