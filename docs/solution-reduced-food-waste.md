## Overview

:::info Huge opportunity 
Reducing food waste is one of the biggest opportunities for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the world—more than restoring forests, insulating buildings, and driving electric vehicles _combined_
:::

* **Food waste & climate change**: Wasted food in the U.S. contributes to roughly 8% of greenhouse gas emissions.
* **Financial implications**: Americans discard food worth about $1,500 annually per family.
* **Breakthroughs**:

  * **Smart fridges**: Order groceries when low, reducing excessive buying and potential waste.
  * **Ugly fruit apps**: Make cosmetically imperfect produce available for purchase.
* Leading initiatives: **Ugly Fruit and Veg Campaign**, **Waste Not Want Not**, **Feeding America**.

## Progress Made

* **Awareness**: Growing realization about the role of food waste in climate change.
* **Innovations**:

  * **Smart fridges**: Auto-ordering systems.
  * **Vertical farming**: Efficient crop production using less land and water.
  * **Biodegradable packaging**: Reducing landfill waste.
  * Use of 'ugly' produce in restaurants.
* Efforts by various companies and initiatives are curbing greenhouse gas emissions through food waste reduction.

## Lessons Learned

* **Financial and environmental cost**: Americans waste food worth $165 billion annually; food waste would be the third-largest greenhouse gas emitter if it were a country.
* **Key strategies**:

  * **Education**: Essential to raising awareness and reducing wastage.
  * **Composting**: Converts organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, helping environment and waste reduction.
  * **Food donations**: Alleviates both food insecurity and wastage.
* Notable entities: **Food and Agriculture Organization**, **Waste Not Compost**, **Feeding America**, **Natural Resources Defense Council**.

## Challenges Ahead

* **Lack of awareness**: More education and publicity about food waste's environmental impact needed.
* **Research & development**: Invest in technology that can further reduce food waste.
* **Support required**: From both government and the private sector.
* Leading organizations: **Food Waste Reduction Alliance**, **Natural Resources Defense Council**, **World Wildlife Fund**.

## Best Path Forward

* **Promotion & awareness**: Educate public on food waste and its environmental repercussions.
* **Policies & incentives**: Create programs that financially benefit businesses and individuals reducing food waste.
* **Infrastructure development**: Invest in tech and structures, like composting facilities, that support waste reduction.
* Pioneering entities: **ReFED**, **LeanPath**, **Food Rescue US**.
