## The Dream Job System

Our model is loosely based off of Austin Belcak's [Dream Job System](https://cultivatedculture.com/djs-podcast/).

:::note The Dream Climate Job System
1. **Find your [Climate Solution](solutions)**
2. **Pick 10 companies** - doing the best work on that solution
3. **Build your portfolio and network** - to prove that you are the best hire, regardless of formal experience

## Tips for navigation

On a desktop, navigation is easy.

There is a sidebar on the left, and a floating table of contents on the right.

**If you are on mobile**

1) Use sidebar icon frequently
2) Jump to the top with the arrow and use the table of contents -->
