## Overview

* There are 1.9 billion people who live less than 100 kilometers from the coast.
* One of the most dangerous and expensive consequences of climate change is the accelerated sea level rise.
* Many countries have already taken action - Japan being a leading example.
* New York City is also actively implementing measures to cope with sea level rise.


## Companies to research

* Software products for city planning like [ESRI](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home), or [Urban Footprint](https://urbanfootprint.com/).
* Consulting, planning, and engineering companies
    * Rebuild by Design - working on New York City’s [Big U project](https://rebuildbydesign.org/work/funded-projects/the-big-u/).
    * [Stantec](https://www.stantec.com/en) - focuses on designing with the community in mind, and the services include coastal protection and flood risk management.
    * [Mott MacDonald](https://www.mottmac.com/) - engaged in infrastructure planning with an eye toward resilience, sustainability, and climate change adaptation.
    * [Boskalis](https://boskalis.com/) - specializing in dredging and maritime services, Boskalis works on coastal defense and riverbank protection projects.
    * [AECOM](https://aecom.com/) - a global firm providing design, consulting, construction, and management services, including work on resilient infrastructure and coastal protection.
    * [HR Wallingford](https://www.hrwallingford.com/) - independent research and consultancy in civil engineering and environmental hydraulics, including studies on coastal and ocean engineering.
    * [Deltares](https://www.deltares.nl/en/)- an independent institute for applied research in the field of water and subsurface, providing expertise on coastal risk management.
    * [Michael Baker International](https://mbakerintl.com/en/) - Offers services in coastal and hydraulic engineering, with a focus on resilient infrastructure design. \

* Consider a government job with your local or regional planning department

## Progress Made in New York City


* [East Side Coastal Resiliency](https://www.nyc.gov/site/escr/index.page) (ESCR) Project aims to provide coastal protection to reduce flood risk from storms and rising sea levels along Manhattan's East Side.
* The [Big U](https://rebuildbydesign.org/work/funded-projects/the-big-u/) project (designing a protective system around Lower Manhattan to guard against sea level rise).
* Code and regulation updates to make [flood-resistant construction](https://zr.planning.nyc.gov/article-vi/chapter-4#64-00) methods and higher elevations for new buildings.
* Investments in the restoration and creation of natural coastal buffers, such as marshes and oyster reefs, to absorb storm surges and adjust to rising sea levels.
* Measures to ensure affordable and accessible flood insurance for residents, particularly those at highest risk.


## Lessons Learned


* Early and proactive planning can better prepare cities for future challenges, minimize damage, and save resources in the long term.
* Balancing physical and natural solutions
* Physical barriers such as seawalls can provide important protection, but they also have limitations.


## Challenges Ahead


* Predicting the exact rate and extent of sea level rise is challenging due to complexities in climate models
* Balancing economic interests, social impacts, and environmental concerns
* The high costs of implementing adaptation measures may strain the city's budget


## Best Path Forward


* Regularly update climate projections and monitor sea level rise for informed decision-making
* Prioritize the upgrading of existing structures and ensure new developments are resilient to sea level rise.
* Share best practices and innovations with other cities, states, and countries.
* In some cases, it may be necessary to consider retreat, moving people and infrastructure out of the most vulnerable areas.
