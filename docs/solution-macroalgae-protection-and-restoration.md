## Progress Made

Significant advancements have been made in macroalgae protection and restoration:

1. **Macroalgae Biofilters**: Filters that remove CO2 and store it as biomass for renewable energy.
2. **Macroalgae Photobioreactors**: Use sunlight to convert CO2 into oxygen, offsetting emissions.
3. **High-Impact Focus**: Restoration efforts target areas with maximum climate change mitigation potential.
4. **Community Engagement**: Local involvement is essential for successful restoration.
5. **Incentives**: Financial and other incentives drive participation in restoration.
6. **Monitoring and Evaluation**: Ongoing assessment ensures effectiveness and necessary adjustments.
