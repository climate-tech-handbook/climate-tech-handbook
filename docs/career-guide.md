You are committed to impactful climate work - congrats!

<!-- !\\[Organice farm soil](../static/img/organic-farming_resize.jpg)
## There are four steps: -->

:::note We will show you how to:

1. Choose your [employer type](#choose-your-employer-type) and look at [job boards](#job-boards)
2. Evaluate your [skills and experience](#evaluate-your-skills-and-experience)
3. Build your [community and network](build-your-community-and-network)
4. Pick your [climate solution](solutions) and [information diet](resources)
   :::

## First: Choose your employer type

:::note You have a choice

1. Try to make your "regular job" more climate positive
2. Leave your "regular job" and work for a dedicated climate organization

   :::
   **Note:** most climate tech companies are early stage startups.

* You can explore [government jobs](https://governmentjobs.com)
* Or look for sustainability positions within larger tech companies

## Job boards

The three most popular:

* [ClimateBase](https://climatebase.org)
* [Climate Tech List](https://climatetechlist.com)
* [Terra.do](https://terra.do/climate-jobs/job-board/)
* ...there are dozens and dozens more on [Nicole Kelner's spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QzarGBkRUvTSx8qu92O0d3zJ6XkblfyyMONSPUsoLgs/edit#gid=0).

## Evaluate your skills and experience

:::note Tech skills and experience

* Do you already have "regular tech" experience - and just need climate knowledge?
* Or...do you need a better tech portfolio + climate knowledge?
  :::

If you'd like a stronger portfolio for tech skills or climate knowledge:
