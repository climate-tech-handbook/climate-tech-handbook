## Overview

In the United States, landfill gas-to-energy (LFGE) facilities have been operational for over 30 years, and there are now over 600 such facilities nationwide. These facilities use landfill gas (LFG) – a mix of about 60 percent methane and 40 percent carbon dioxide – to generate electricity, heat, or both. In addition, many facilities use LFG to power on-site equipment, such as boilers, dryers, and ovens.

The use of LFG to generate energy reduces greenhouse gas emissions in two ways. First, it displaces the use of fossil fuels, such as natural gas, coal, and oil, which would otherwise be used to generate the same amount of energy. Second, it reduces emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, from landfills.

Over the past few years, there have been several breakthrough technologies that have contributed to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from LFGE facilities. For example, new flares have been developed that can more effectively destroy methane, and new engine technologies have been introduced that are more efficient in converting methane to energy. In addition, many facilities are now using anaerobic digesters to process LFG, which not only reduces emissions but also produces a renewable source of energy.

Companies and organizations that have been at the forefront of developing and deploying these technologies include the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Energy, the Gas Technology Institute, and the Solid Waste Association of North America.

## Progress Made

There has been significant progress made in developing landfill methane capture to reverse climate change. Breakthrough technologies that have been developed include:

- Anaerobic Digestion: This is a process that breaks down organic waste in the absence of oxygen, producing methane gas that can be used to generate electricity.

- Gas-to-Energy: This technology converts methane gas into electricity, which can then be used to power homes and businesses.

- Carbon Sequestration: This involves capturing methane gas and storing it in underground reservoirs, preventing it from entering the atmosphere.

Organizations that have been at the forefront of developing these technologies include the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Energy, and the Climate Change Mitigation Initiative.

## Lessons Learned

Some key lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of Landfill Methane Capture to reverse climate change are:

1. Landfill methane capture is a promising technology for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but its effectiveness depends on a number of factors including the size and location of the landfill, the type of waste disposed of, and the climate.

2. Landfill methane capture projects have been successful in reducing emissions in a number of cases, but have also failed to meet expectations in other cases.

3. A number of companies and organizations are working on developing and implementing landfill methane capture projects, and there is some progress being made in this area.

4. It is important to learn from both the successes and failures of landfill methane capture projects in order to improve the effectiveness of this technology.

## Challenges Ahead

The major challenge that remains in the development and implementation of Landfill Methane Capture to reverse climate change is the lack of infrastructure and investment. There are currently no large-scale commercial facilities in operation and the technology is still in the early stages of development. There are also no international standards or regulations in place for the capture and use of landfill gas. This makes it difficult to scale up and widely adopt the technology.

Some companies and organizations that have been at the forefront of this solution include the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Fund (CCMAF). The EPA has been working to promote the capture and use of landfill gas as a renewable energy source. The CCMAF has been investing in research and development of the technology.

Some lessons that have been learned from the development of this technology include the need for:

-A long-term commitment from government and industry

-A clear and consistent policy framework

-A well-designed and implemented regulatory regime

-A robust and efficient market for landfill gas

-A strong technical and financial support system

## Best Path Forward

The best path forward for the continued development and implementation of Landfill Methane Capture to effectively mitigate the effects of climate change is to continue to invest in research and development to improve the technology and to make it more affordable. In addition, policy changes at the local, state, and federal level will be necessary to incentivize the use of this technology.

Organizations such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the United States and the Climate Change and Emissions Management Corporation (CCEMC) in Canada have been at the forefront of research and development in this area. In the United States, the EPA has invested over $60 million in research and development of landfill methane capture technology since 2000 (1). In Canada, the CCEMC has invested $30 million in research and development since 2008 (2).

One of the key lessons that has been learned from the progress made in this area is that landfill methane capture technology is most effective when it is implemented at new or expanding landfills. This is because it is more expensive and difficult to retrofit existing landfills with this technology. As a result, policy changes that incentivize the use of this technology at new and expanding landfills are likely to be the most effective in terms of mitigating climate change.
