### Quality Journalism

Journalism is about reporting the truth with fairness and accuracy.

Use evidence when you have it.

Wikipedia's [verifiability guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability) work well.

If you don't have strong evidence, make it very clear that this is an opinion or speculation. 


### Measurable Impact

There is a lot of greenwashing out there.

We need to identify misleading information and half-truths about actions that appear meaningful, but fail to make any significant impact.


### Strong Community

#### Positive skepticism

Productive feedback is critical for every contributor.

It is important be skeptical while displaying a respectful attitude when critiquing others.

If you are the one whose ideas are being critiqued, understand that the person critiquing is just trying to help.

#### Productive debate

Criticize ideas not people.

#### Community health

Some online communities are remarkably successful, while others are toxic.

Community health is our number one priority.

Be professional and respectful at all times.
