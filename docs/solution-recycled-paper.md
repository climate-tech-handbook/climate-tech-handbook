## Overview

Recycled paper has gained popularity due to increased awareness of environmental issues. It's used in various applications including newspapers, magazines, office paper, and packaging. While recycled paper production generally requires less energy and may emit fewer greenhouse gases compared to virgin paper, the environmental benefits can vary depending on factors such as transportation, processing methods, and the source of energy used in production.
