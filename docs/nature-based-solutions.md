## The Big Question:

To what degree should nature-based solutions be a part of carbon markets?

**Additionally**:

 - Should we as an industry be trying to fund things like [regenerative agriculture](solution-regenerative-annual-cropping) and forestry with carbon credits?

 - Or should we fund those things via government programs or philanthropy? 

 - If its a mixture of both, where is the line?
