## Progress Made

Significant advancements have been made in seafloor protection technologies:

1. **Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)**: Injecting CO2 into seafloor sediments to store carbon dioxide.
2. **Ocean Fertilization**: Boosting marine plant growth to absorb CO2.
3. **Seagrass Restoration**: Restoring seagrass meadows to capture and store significant amounts of carbon.

**Case Studies:**
1. **Carbon Engineering, Canada**: Develops direct air capture technology and explores seafloor carbon storage ([Carbon Engineering](https://carbonengineering.com)). While promising, the long-term environmental impacts require further study.
2. **Ocean Power Technologies, USA**: Develops ocean thermal energy conversion and tidal energy technologies ([Ocean Power Technologies](https://oceanpowertechnologies.com)). The scalability and economic viability of these technologies remain challenges.
3. **Marine Renewables Canada, Canada**: Promotes marine renewable energy solutions ([Marine Renewables Canada](https://www.marinerenewables.ca)). The integration of renewable energy with seafloor protection efforts is beneficial but requires further research.
